The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS), two departments within the U.S. Federal Government’s Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS) provide the following guidelines for coding and reporting using the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). These
guidelines should be used as a companion document to the official version of the ICD-10-CM as
published on the NCHS website. The ICD-10-CM is a morbidity classification published by the
United States for classifying diagnoses and reason for visits in all health care settings. The ICD-
10-CM is based on the ICD-10, the statistical classification of disease published by the World
Health Organization (WHO).
These guidelines have been approved by the four organizations that make up the Cooperating
Parties for the ICD-10-CM: the American Hospital Association (AHA), the American Health
Information Management Association (AHIMA), CMS, and NCHS.
These guidelines are a set of rules that have been developed to accompany and complement the
official conventions and instructions provided within the ICD-10-CM itself. The instructions and
conventions of the classification take precedence over guidelines. These guidelines are based on
the coding and sequencing instructions in the Tabular List and Alphabetic Index of ICD-10-CM,
but provide additional instruction. Adherence to these guidelines when assigning ICD-10-CM
diagnosis codes is required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). The diagnosis codes (Tabular List and Alphabetic Index) have been adopted under
HIPAA for all healthcare settings. A joint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is
essential to achieve complete and accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of
diagnoses and procedures. These guidelines have been developed to assist both the healthcare
provider and the coder in identifying those diagnoses that are to be reported. The importance of
consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized. Without
such documentation accurate coding cannot be achieved. The entire record should be reviewed to
determine the specific reason for the encounter and the conditions treated.
The term encounter is used for all settings, including hospital admissions. In the context of these
guidelines, the term provider is used throughout the guidelines to mean physician or any qualified
health care practitioner who is legally accountable for establishing the patient’s diagnosis. Only
this set of guidelines, approved by the Cooperating Parties, is official.
The guidelines are organized into sections. Section I includes the structure and conventions of the
classification and general guidelines that apply to the entire classification, and chapter-specific
guidelines that correspond to the chapters as they are arranged in the classification. Section II
includes guidelines for selection of principal diagnosis for non-outpatient settings. Section III
includes guidelines for reporting additional diagnoses in non-outpatient settings. Section IV is for
outpatient coding and reporting. It is necessary to review all sections of the guidelines to fully
understand all of the rules and instructions needed to code properly.

Section I. Conventions, general coding guidelines and chapter
specific guidelines
The conventions, general guidelines and chapter-specific guidelines are applicable to all
health care settings unless otherwise indicated. The conventions and instructions of the
classification take precedence over guidelines.
A. Conventions for the ICD-10-CM
The conventions for the ICD-10-CM are the general rules for use of the classification
independent of the guidelines. These conventions are incorporated within the Alphabetic Index
and Tabular List of the ICD-10-CM as instructional notes.
1. The Alphabetic Index and Tabular List
The ICD-10-CM is divided into the Alphabetic Index, an alphabetical list of terms and
their corresponding code, and the Tabular List, a structured list of codes divided into
chapters based on body system or condition. The Alphabetic Index consists of the
following parts: the Index of Diseases and Injury, the Index of External Causes of
Injury, the Table of Neoplasms and the Table of Drugs and Chemicals.
See Section I.C.2. Neoplasms
See Section I.C.19. Adverse effects, poisoning, underdosing and toxic effects
2. Format and Structure:
The ICD-10-CM Tabular List contains categories, subcategories and codes. Characters
for categories, subcategories and codes may be either a letter or a number. All
categories are 3 characters. A three-character category that has no further subdivision is
equivalent to a code. Subcategories are either 4 or 5 characters. Codes may be 3, 4, 5, 6
or 7 characters. That is, each level of subdivision after a category is a subcategory. The
final level of subdivision is a code. Codes that have applicable 7th characters are still
referred to as codes, not subcategories. A code that has an applicable 7th character is
considered invalid without the 7th character.
The ICD-10-CM uses an indented format for ease in reference.
3. Use of codes for reporting purposes
For reporting purposes only codes are permissible, not categories or subcategories, and
any applicable 7th character is required.
4. Placeholder character
The ICD-10-CM utilizes a placeholder character “X”. The “X” is used as a placeholder
at certain codes to allow for future expansion. An example of this is at the poisoning,
adverse effect and underdosing codes, categories T36-T50. Where a placeholder exists,
the X must be used in order for the code to be considered a valid code.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 7 of 121

5. 7th Characters
Certain ICD-10-CM categories have applicable 7th characters. The applicable 7th
character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List
instruct. The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field. If a code
that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in
the empty characters.
6. Abbreviations
a. Alphabetic Index abbreviations
NEC “Not elsewhere classifiable”
This abbreviation in the Alphabetic Index represents “other specified.”
When a specific code is not available for a condition, the Alphabetic
Index directs the coder to the “other specified” code in the Tabular List.
NOS “Not otherwise specified”
This abbreviation is the equivalent of unspecified.
b. Tabular List abbreviations
NEC “Not elsewhere classifiable”
This abbreviation in the Tabular List represents “other specified”. When
a specific code is not available for a condition, the Tabular List includes
an NEC entry under a code to identify the code as the “other specified”
code.
NOS “Not otherwise specified”
This abbreviation is the equivalent of unspecified.
7. Punctuation
[ ] Brackets are used in the Tabular List to enclose synonyms, alternative wording or
explanatory phrases. Brackets are used in the Alphabetic Index to identify
manifestation codes.
( ) Parentheses are used in both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List to enclose
supplementary words that may be present or absent in the statement of a disease or
procedure without affecting the code number to which it is assigned. The terms
within the parentheses are referred to as nonessential modifiers. The nonessential
modifiers in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases apply to subterms following a main
term except when a nonessential modifier and a subentry are mutually exclusive,
the subentry takes precedence. For example, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index
under the main term Enteritis, “acute” is a nonessential modifier and “chronic” is a
subentry. In this case, the nonessential modifier “acute” does not apply to the
subentry “chronic”.
: Colons are used in the Tabular List after an incomplete term which needs one or
more of the modifiers following the colon to make it assignable to a given
category.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 8 of 121

, Commas are used in the Alphabetic Index and have different meanings based
on the context of the Index entry, including alternate verbiage, modifier (essential
and nonessential), or alternative for “and/or.”
8. Use of “and”.
See Section I.A.14. Use of the term “And”
9. Other and Unspecified codes
a. “Other” codes
Codes titled “other” or “other specified” are for use when the information in the
medical record provides detail for which a specific code does not exist.
Alphabetic Index entries with NEC in the line designate “other” codes in the
Tabular List. These Alphabetic Index entries represent specific disease entities
for which no specific code exists, so the term is included within an “other” code.
b. “Unspecified” codes
Codes titled “unspecified” are for use when the information in the medical
record is insufficient to assign a more specific code. For those categories for
which an unspecified code is not provided, the “other specified” code may
represent both other and unspecified.
See Section I.B.18. Use of Signs/Symptom/Unspecified Codes
10. Includes Notes
This note appears immediately under a three-character code title to further define, or give
examples of, the content of the category.
11. Inclusion terms
List of terms is included under some codes. These terms are the conditions for which
that code is to be used. The terms may be synonyms of the code title, or, in the case of
“other specified” codes, the terms are a list of the various conditions assigned to that
code. The inclusion terms are not necessarily exhaustive. Additional terms found only
in the Alphabetic Index may also be assigned to a code.
12. Excludes Notes
The ICD-10-CM has two types of excludes notes. Each type of note has a different
definition for use, but they are all similar in that they indicate that codes excluded from
each other are independent of each other.
a. Excludes1
A type 1 Excludes note is a pure excludes note. It means “NOT CODED
HERE!” An Excludes1 note indicates that the code excluded should never be
used at the same time as the code above the Excludes1 note. An Excludes1 is
used when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form
versus an acquired form of the same condition.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 9 of 121

An exception to the Excludes1 definition is the circumstance when the two
conditions are unrelated to each other. If it is not clear whether the two
conditions involving an Excludes1 note are related or not, query the provider.
For example, code F45.8, Other somatoform disorders, has an Excludes1 note
for "sleep related teeth grinding (G47.63)," because "teeth grinding" is an
inclusion term under F45.8. Only one of these two codes should be assigned for
teeth grinding. However psychogenic dysmenorrhea is also an inclusion term
under F45.8, and a patient could have both this condition and sleep related teeth
grinding. In this case, the two conditions are clearly unrelated to each other, and
so it would be appropriate to report F45.8 and G47.63 together.
b. Excludes2
A type 2 Excludes note represents “Not included here.” An excludes2 note
indicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition represented by
the code, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. When an
Excludes2 note appears under a code, it is acceptable to use both the code and
the excluded code together, when appropriate.
13. Etiology/manifestation convention (“code first”, “use additional
code” and “in diseases classified elsewhere” notes)
Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system
manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, the ICD-10-CM has
a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first, if
applicable, followed by the manifestation. Wherever such a combination exists, there is
a “use additional code” note at the etiology code, and a “code first” note at the
manifestation code. These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of
the codes, etiology followed by manifestation.
In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, “in diseases classified
elsewhere.” Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/ manifestation
convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. “In diseases
classified elsewhere” codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principal
diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code
and they must be listed following the underlying condition. See category F02, Dementia
in other diseases classified elsewhere, for an example of this convention.
There are manifestation codes that do not have “in diseases classified elsewhere” in the
title. For such codes, there is a “use additional code” note at the etiology code and a
“code first” note at the manifestation code, and the rules for sequencing apply.
In addition to the notes in the Tabular List, these conditions also have a specific
Alphabetic Index entry structure. In the Alphabetic Index both conditions are listed
together with the etiology code first followed by the manifestation codes in brackets.
The code in brackets is always to be sequenced second.
An example of the etiology/manifestation convention is dementia with Parkinson’s
disease. In the Alphabetic Index, a code from category G20 is listed first, followed by
code F02.80 or F02.81- in brackets. A code from category G20- represents the
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 10 of 121

underlying etiology, Parkinson’s disease, and must be sequenced first, whereas codes
F02.80 and F02.81- represent the manifestation of dementia in diseases classified
elsewhere, with or without behavioral disturbance.
“Code first” and “Use additional code” notes are also used as sequencing rules in the
classification for certain codes that are not part of an etiology/ manifestation
combination.
See Section I.B.7. Multiple coding for a single condition.
14. “And”
The word “and” should be interpreted to mean either “and” or “or” when it appears in a
title.
For example, cases of “tuberculosis of bones”, “tuberculosis of joints” and “tuberculosis
of bones and joints” are classified to subcategory A18.0, Tuberculosis of bones and
joints.
15. “With”
The word “with” or “in” should be interpreted to mean “associated with” or “due to”
when it appears in a code title, the Alphabetic Index (either under a main term or
subterm), or an instructional note in the Tabular List. The classification presumes a
causal relationship between the two conditions linked by these terms in the Alphabetic
Index or Tabular List. These conditions should be coded as related even in the absence
of provider documentation explicitly linking them, unless the documentation clearly
states the conditions are unrelated or when another guideline exists that specifically
requires a documented linkage between two conditions (e.g., sepsis guideline for “acute
organ dysfunction that is not clearly associated with the sepsis”).
For conditions not specifically linked by these relational terms in the classification or
when a guideline requires that a linkage between two conditions be explicitly
documented, provider documentation must link the conditions in order to code them as
related.
The word “with” in the Alphabetic Index is sequenced immediately following the main
term or subterm, not in alphabetical order.
16. “See” and “See Also”
The “see” instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index indicates that
another term should be referenced. It is necessary to go to the main term referenced
with the “see” note to locate the correct code.
A “see also” instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index instructs that
there is another main term that may also be referenced that may provide additional
Alphabetic Index entries that may be useful. It is not necessary to follow the “see also”
note when the original main term provides the necessary code.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 11 of 121

17. “Code also” note
A “code also” note instructs that two codes may be required to fully describe a
condition, but this note does not provide sequencing direction. The sequencing depends
on the circumstances of the encounter.
18. Default codes
A code listed next to a main term in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index is referred to as a
default code. The default code represents that condition that is most commonly
associated with the main term or is the unspecified code for the condition. If a condition
is documented in a medical record (for example, appendicitis) without any additional
information, such as acute or chronic, the default code should be assigned.
19. Code assignment and Clinical Criteria
The assignment of a diagnosis code is based on the provider’s diagnostic statement that
the condition exists. The provider’s statement that the patient has a particular condition
is sufficient. Code assignment is not based on clinical criteria used by the provider to
establish the diagnosis. If there is conflicting medical record documentation, query the
provider.
B. General Coding Guidelines
1. Locating a code in the ICD-10-CM
To select a code in the classification that corresponds to a diagnosis or reason for visit
documented in a medical record, first locate the term in the Alphabetic Index, and then
verify the code in the Tabular List. Read and be guided by instructional notations that
appear in both the Alphabetic Index and the Tabular List.
It is essential to use both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List when locating and
assigning a code. The Alphabetic Index does not always provide the full code. Selection
of the full code, including laterality and any applicable 7th character can only be done in
the Tabular List. A dash (-) at the end of an Alphabetic Index entry indicates that
additional characters are required. Even if a dash is not included at the Alphabetic Index
entry, it is necessary to refer to the Tabular List to verify that no 7th character is
required.
2. Level of Detail in Coding
Diagnosis codes are to be used and reported at their highest number of characters
available and to the highest level of specificity documented in the medical record.
ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes are composed of codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters.
Codes with three characters are included in ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of
codes that may be further subdivided by the use of fourth and/or fifth characters and/or
sixth characters, which provide greater detail.
A three-character code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. A code is invalid
if it has not been coded to the full number of characters required for that code, including
the 7th character, if applicable.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 12 of 121

3. Code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99.8, U00-U85
The appropriate code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99.8, and U00-U85
must be used to identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems, complaints or
other reason(s) for the encounter/visit.
4. Signs and symptoms
Codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnoses, are acceptable for
reporting purposes when a related definitive diagnosis has not been established
(confirmed) by the provider. Chapter 18 of ICD-10-CM, Symptoms, Signs, and
Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not Elsewhere Classified (codes
R00.0 - R99) contains many, but not all, codes for symptoms.
See Section I.B.18. Use of Signs/Symptom/Unspecified Codes
5. Conditions that are an integral part of a disease process
Signs and symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process should not be
assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise instructed by the classification.
6. Conditions that are not an integral part of a disease process
Additional signs and symptoms that may not be associated routinely with a disease
process should be coded when present.
7. Multiple coding for a single condition
In addition to the etiology/manifestation convention that requires two codes to fully
describe a single condition that affects multiple body systems, there are other single
conditions that also require more than one code. “Use additional code” notes are found
in the Tabular List at codes that are not part of an etiology/manifestation pair where a
secondary code is useful to fully describe a condition. The sequencing rule is the same
as the etiology/manifestation pair, “use additional code” indicates that a secondary code
should be added, if known.
For example, for bacterial infections that are not included in chapter 1, a secondary code
from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus, as the cause of
diseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases
classified elsewhere, may be required to identify the bacterial organism causing the
infection. A “use additional code” note will normally be found at the infectious disease
code, indicating a need for the organism code to be added as a secondary code.
“Code first” notes are also under certain codes that are not specifically manifestation
codes but may be due to an underlying cause. When there is a “code first” note and an
underlying condition is present, the underlying condition should be sequenced first, if
known.
“Code, if applicable, any causal condition first” notes indicate that this code may be
assigned as a principal diagnosis when the causal condition is unknown or not
applicable. If a causal condition is known, then the code for that condition should be
sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 13 of 121

Multiple codes may be needed for sequela, complication codes and obstetric codes to
more fully describe a condition. See the specific guidelines for these conditions for
further instruction.
8. Acute and Chronic Conditions
If the same condition is described as both acute (subacute) and chronic, and separate
subentries exist in the Alphabetic Index at the same indentation level, code both and
sequence the acute (subacute) code first.
9. Combination Code
A combination code is a single code used to classify:
Two diagnoses, or
A diagnosis with an associated secondary process (manifestation)
A diagnosis with an associated complication
Combination codes are identified by referring to subterm entries in the Alphabetic Index
and by reading the inclusion and exclusion notes in the Tabular List.
Assign only the combination code when that code fully identifies the diagnostic
conditions involved or when the Alphabetic Index so directs. Multiple coding should
not be used when the classification provides a combination code that clearly identifies
all of the elements documented in the diagnosis. When the combination code lacks
necessary specificity in describing the manifestation or complication, an additional code
should be used as a secondary code.
10. Sequela (Late Effects)
A sequela is the residual effect (condition produced) after the acute phase of an illness
or injury has terminated. There is no time limit on when a sequela code can be used.
The residual may be apparent early, such as in cerebral infarction, or it may occur
months or years later, such as that due to a previous injury. Examples of sequela
include: scar formation resulting from a burn, deviated septum due to a nasal fracture,
and infertility due to tubal occlusion from old tuberculosis. Coding of sequela generally
requires two codes sequenced in the following order: the condition or nature of the
sequela is sequenced first. The sequela code is sequenced second.
An exception to the above guidelines are those instances where the code for the sequela
is followed by a manifestation code identified in the Tabular List and title, or the
sequela code has been expanded (at the fourth, fifth or sixth character levels) to include
the manifestation(s). The code for the acute phase of an illness or injury that led to the
sequela is never used with a code for the late effect.
See Section I.C.9. Sequelae of cerebrovascular disease
See Section I.C.15. Sequelae of complication of pregnancy, childbirth and the
puerperium
See Section I.C.19. Application of 7th characters for Chapter 19
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 14 of 121

11. Impending or Threatened Condition
Code any condition described at the time of discharge as “impending” or “threatened”
as follows:
If it did occur, code as confirmed diagnosis.
If it did not occur, reference the Alphabetic Index to determine if the condition has a
subentry term for “impending” or “threatened” and also reference main term entries
for “Impending” and for “Threatened.”
If the subterms are listed, assign the given code.
If the subterms are not listed, code the existing underlying condition(s) and not the
condition described as impending or threatened.
12. Reporting Same Diagnosis Code More than Once
Each unique ICD-10-CM diagnosis code may be reported only once for an encounter.
This applies to bilateral conditions when there are no distinct codes identifying laterality
or two different conditions classified to the same ICD-10-CM diagnosis code.
13. Laterality
Some ICD-10-CM codes indicate laterality, specifying whether the condition occurs on
the left, right or is bilateral. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral,
assign separate codes for both the left and right side. If the side is not identified in the
medical record, assign the code for the unspecified side.
When a patient has a bilateral condition and each side is treated during separate
encounters, assign the "bilateral" code (as the condition still exists on both sides),
including for the encounter to treat the first side. For the second encounter for treatment
after one side has previously been treated and the condition no longer exists on that
side, assign the appropriate unilateral code for the side where the condition still exists
(e.g., cataract surgery performed on each eye in separate encounters). The bilateral code
would not be assigned for the subsequent encounter, as the patient no longer has the
condition in the previously-treated site. If the treatment on the first side did not
completely resolve the condition, then the bilateral code would still be appropriate.
When laterality is not documented by the patient’s provider, code assignment for the
affected side may be based on medical record documentation from other clinicians. If
there is conflicting medical record documentation regarding the affected side, the
patient’s provider should be queried for clarification. Codes for “unspecified” side
should rarely be used, such as when the documentation in the record is insufficient to
determine the affected side and it is not possible to obtain clarification.
14. Documentation by Clinicians Other than the Patient's Provider
Code assignment is based on the documentation by the patient's provider (i.e., physician
or other qualified healthcare practitioner legally accountable for establishing the
patient's diagnosis). There are a few exceptions when code assignment may be based on
medical record documentation from clinicians who are not the patient’s provider (i.e.,
physician or other qualified healthcare practitioner legally accountable for establishing
the patient’s diagnosis). In this context, “clinicians” other than the patient’s provider
refer to healthcare professionals permitted, based on regulatory or accreditation
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 15 of 121

requirements or internal hospital policies, to document in a patient’s official medical
record.
These exceptions include codes for:
• Body Mass Index (BMI)
• Depth of non-pressure chronic ulcers
• Pressure ulcer stage
• Coma scale
• NIH stroke scale (NIHSS)
• Social determinants of health (SDOH) classified to Chapter 21
• Laterality
• Blood alcohol level
• Underimmunization status
• Firearm injury intent
This information is typically, or may be, documented by other clinicians involved in the
care of the patient (e.g., a dietitian often documents the BMI, a nurse often documents
the pressure ulcer stages, and an emergency medical technician often documents the
coma scale). However, the associated diagnosis (such as overweight, obesity, acute
stroke, pressure ulcer, or a condition classifiable to category F10, Alcohol related
disorders) must be documented by the patient’s provider. If there is conflicting medical
record documentation, either from the same clinician or different clinicians, the
patient’s provider should be queried for clarification.
The BMI, coma scale, NIHSS, blood alcohol level codes, codes for social determinants
of health and underimmunization status should only be reported as secondary diagnoses.
See Section I.C.21.c.17. for additional information regarding coding social
determinants of health.
15. Syndromes
Follow the Alphabetic Index guidance when coding syndromes. In the absence of
Alphabetic Index guidance, assign codes for the documented manifestations of the
syndrome. Additional codes for manifestations that are not an integral part of the
disease process may also be assigned when the condition does not have a unique code.
16. Documentation of Complications of Care
Code assignment is based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship between
the condition and the care or procedure, unless otherwise instructed by the
classification. The guideline extends to any complications of care, regardless of the
chapter the code is located in. It is important to note that not all conditions that occur
during or following medical care or surgery are classified as complications. There must
be a cause-and-effect relationship between the care provided and the condition, and the
documentation must support that the condition is clinically significant. It is not
necessary for the provider to explicitly document the term “complication.” For example,
if the condition alters the course of the surgery as documented in the operative report,
then it would be appropriate to report a complication code. Query the provider for
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 16 of 121

clarification if the documentation is not clear as to the relationship between the
condition and the care or procedure.
17. Borderline Diagnosis
If the provider documents a "borderline" diagnosis at the time of discharge, the
diagnosis is coded as confirmed, unless the classification provides a specific entry (e.g.,
borderline diabetes). If a borderline condition has a specific index entry in ICD-10-CM,
it should be coded as such. Since borderline conditions are not uncertain diagnoses, no
distinction is made between the care setting (inpatient versus outpatient). Whenever the
documentation is unclear regarding a borderline condition, coders are encouraged to
query for clarification.
18. Use of Sign/Symptom/Unspecified Codes
Sign/symptom and “unspecified” codes have acceptable, even necessary, uses. While
specific diagnosis codes should be reported when they are supported by the available
medical record documentation and clinical knowledge of the patient’s health condition,
there are instances when signs/symptoms or unspecified codes are the best choices for
accurately reflecting the healthcare encounter. Each healthcare encounter should be
coded to the level of certainty known for that encounter.
As stated in the introductory section of these official coding guidelines, a joint effort
between the healthcare provider and the coder is essential to achieve complete and
accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of diagnoses and procedures.
The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be
overemphasized. Without such documentation accurate coding cannot be achieved. The
entire record should be reviewed to determine the specific reason for the encounter and
the conditions treated.
If a definitive diagnosis has not been established by the end of the encounter, it is
appropriate to report codes for sign(s) and/or symptom(s) in lieu of a definitive
diagnosis. When sufficient clinical information isn’t known or available about a
particular health condition to assign a more specific code, it is acceptable to report the
appropriate “unspecified” code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined,
but not the specific type). Unspecified codes should be reported when they are the codes
that most accurately reflect what is known about the patient’s condition at the time of
that particular encounter. It would be inappropriate to select a specific code that is not
supported by the medical record documentation or conduct medically unnecessary
diagnostic testing in order to determine a more specific code.
19. Coding for Healthcare Encounters in Hurricane Aftermath
a. Use of External Cause of Morbidity Codes
An external cause of morbidity code should be assigned to identify the cause of the
injury(ies) incurred as a result of the hurricane. The use of external cause of
morbidity codes is supplemental to the application of ICD-10-CM codes. External
cause of morbidity codes are never to be recorded as a principal diagnosis (first-
listed in non-inpatient settings). The appropriate injury code should be sequenced
before any external cause codes. The external cause of morbidity codes capture how
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 17 of 121

the injury or health condition happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or
accidental; or intentional, such as suicide or assault), the place where the event
occurred, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the person’s status
(e.g., civilian, military). They should not be assigned for encounters to treat
hurricane victims’ medical conditions when no injury, adverse effect or poisoning is
involved. External cause of morbidity codes should be assigned for each encounter
for care and treatment of the injury. External cause of morbidity codes may be
assigned in all health care settings. For the purpose of capturing complete and
accurate ICD-10-CM data in the aftermath of the hurricane, a healthcare setting
should be considered as any location where medical care is provided by licensed
healthcare professionals.
b. Sequencing of External Causes of Morbidity Codes
Codes for cataclysmic events, such as a hurricane, take priority over all other
external cause codes except child and adult abuse and terrorism and should be
sequenced before other external cause of injury codes. Assign as many external
cause of morbidity codes as necessary to fully explain each cause. For example, if
an injury occurs as a result of a building collapse during the hurricane, external
cause codes for both the hurricane and the building collapse should be assigned,
with the external causes code for hurricane being sequenced as the first external
cause code. For injuries incurred as a direct result of the hurricane, assign the
appropriate code(s) for the injuries, followed by the code X37.0-, Hurricane (with
the appropriate 7th character), and any other applicable external cause of injury
codes. Code X37.0- also should be assigned when an injury is incurred as a result of
flooding caused by a levee breaking related to the hurricane. Code X38.-, Flood
(with the appropriate 7th character), should be assigned when an injury is from
flooding resulting directly from the storm. Code X36.0.-, Collapse of dam or man-
made structure, should not be assigned when the cause of the collapse is due to the
hurricane. Use of code X36.0- is limited to collapses of man-made structures due to
earth surface movements, not due to storm surges directly from a hurricane.
c. Other External Causes of Morbidity Code Issues
For injuries that are not a direct result of the hurricane, such as an evacuee that has
incurred an injury as a result of a motor vehicle accident, assign the appropriate
external cause of morbidity code(s) to describe the cause of the injury, but do not
assign code X37.0-, Hurricane. If it is not clear whether the injury was a direct result
of the hurricane, assume the injury is due to the hurricane and assign code X37.0-,
Hurricane, as well as any other applicable external cause of morbidity codes. In
addition to code X37.0-, Hurricane, other possible applicable external cause of
morbidity codes include:
X30-, Exposure to excessive natural heat
X31-, Exposure to excessive natural cold
X38-, Flood
d. Use of Z codes
Z codes (other reasons for healthcare encounters) may be assigned as appropriate to
further explain the reasons for presenting for healthcare services, including transfers
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 18 of 121

between healthcare facilities, or provide additional information relevant to a patient
encounter. The ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting identify
which codes maybe assigned as principal or first-listed diagnosis only, secondary
diagnosis only, or principal/first-listed or secondary (depending on the
circumstances). Possible applicable Z codes include:
Z59.0-, Homelessness
Z59.1, Inadequate housing
Z59.5, Extreme poverty
Z75.1, Person awaiting admission to adequate facility elsewhere
Z75.3, Unavailability and inaccessibility of health-care facilities
Z75.4, Unavailability and inaccessibility of other helping agencies
Z76.2, Encounter for health supervision and care of other healthy infant and
child
Z99.12, Encounter for respirator [ventilator] dependence during power
failure
The external cause of morbidity codes and the Z codes listed above are not
an all-inclusive list. Other codes may be applicable to the encounter based
upon the documentation. Assign as many codes as necessary to fully explain
each healthcare encounter. Since patient history information may be very
limited, use any available documentation to assign the appropriate external
cause of morbidity and Z codes.
20. Multiple Sites Coding
The classification defines “multiple” as involving two or more sites. Follow chapter-
specific guidelines for assigning codes for “multiple sites.” In the absence of chapter-
specific guidelines, assign codes describing specified sites individually when
documented. When the specified site(s) are not documented, assign the appropriate
code for “multiple sites.”
C. Chapter-Specific Coding Guidelines
In addition to general coding guidelines, there are guidelines for specific diagnoses and/or
conditions in the classification. Unless otherwise indicated, these guidelines apply to all health
care settings. Please refer to Section II for guidelines on the selection of principal diagnosis.
1. Chapter 1: Certain Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (A00-B99), U07.1,
U09.9
a. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infections
1) Code only confirmed cases
Code only confirmed cases of HIV infection/illness. This is an exception
to the hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 19 of 121

In this context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of
positive serology or culture for HIV; the provider’s diagnostic statement
that the patient is HIV positive or has an HIV-related illness is sufficient.
2) Selection and sequencing of HIV codes
(a) HIV disease
If the term “AIDS” or “HIV disease” is documented or if the
patient is treated for any HIV-related illness or is described
as having any condition(s) resulting from the patient’s HIV
positive status; code B20, Human immunodeficiency virus
[HIV], should be assigned.
(b) Patient admitted for HIV-related condition
If a patient is admitted for an HIV-related condition, the principal
diagnosis should be B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]
disease followed by additional diagnosis codes for all reported
HIV-related conditions.
An exception to this guideline is if the reason for admission is
hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with HIV disease. Assign
code D59.31, Infection-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome,
followed by code B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]
disease.
(c) Patient with HIV disease admitted for unrelated condition
If a patient with HIV disease is admitted for an unrelated
condition (such as a traumatic injury), the code for the unrelated
condition (e.g., the nature of injury code) should be the principal
diagnosis. Code B20 would be reported as a secondary
diagnosis. Codes for other documented conditions should
also be reported as secondary diagnoses.
(d) Patient newly diagnosed with HIV disease
Whether the patient is newly diagnosed or has had previous
admissions/encounters for HIV conditions is irrelevant to the
sequencing decision.
(e) Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus
When “HIV positive,” “HIV test positive,” or similar
terminology is documented, and there is no documentation of
symptoms or HIV-related illness, code Z21, Asymptomatic
human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status, should
be assigned.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 20 of 121

(f) Inconclusive HIV serology
Patients with documentation of inconclusive HIV serology,
may be assigned code R75, Inconclusive laboratory evidence of
human immunodeficiency virus [HIV].
(g) Previously diagnosed HIV-related illness
Patients with documentation of a prior diagnosis of an
HIV-related illness should be coded to B20. Once an
HIV-related illness has developed, code B20 should always be
assigned on every subsequent admission/encounter. Patients
previously diagnosed with any HIV illness (B20) should never
be assigned to R75, Inconclusive laboratory evidence of
human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or Z21, Asymptomatic
human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status.
(h) HIV Infection in Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium
When a patient presents during pregnancy, childbirth or the
puerperium with documented symptomatic HIV disease or an
HIV related illness, assign a code from subcategory O98.7,
Human immunodeficiency [HIV] disease complicating
pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, followed by code
B20 and additional code(s) for any HIV-related illness(es).
Codes from Chapter 15 always take sequencing priority.
When a patient presents during pregnancy, childbirth or the
puerperium with documented asymptomatic HIV infection
status or is HIV-positive, assign a code from subcategory
O98.7 followed by code Z21.
(i) Encounters for HIV testing
If a patient without signs or symptoms is tested for HIV,
assign code Z11.4, Encounter for screening for human
immunodeficiency virus [HIV]. Use additional codes for any
associated high-risk behavior, if applicable.
If a patient with signs or symptoms of HIV presents for HIV
testing, code the signs and symptoms. An additional
counseling code Z71.7, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]
counseling, may be assigned if counseling is provided during
the encounter for the test. Code Z11.4, Encounter for
screening for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], should
not be assigned if HIV signs or symptoms are present.
When a patient presents for follow up regarding their HIV
test results and the test result is negative, assign code Z71.7,
Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] counseling.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 21 of 121

If the results are positive, see previous guidelines and assign
codes as appropriate.
(j) HIV disease or HIV positive status managed by antiretroviral
medication
If a patient with documented HIV disease, HIV-related illness or
AIDS is currently managed on antiretroviral medications, assign
code B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease.
If a patient with documented HIV positive status is currently
managed on antiretroviral medication, assign code Z21,
Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]
infection status, in the absence of any additional
documentation of HIV disease, HIV-related illness or AIDS.
Code Z79.899, Other long term (current) drug therapy, may be
assigned as an additional code to identify the long-term (current)
use of antiretroviral medications.
(k) Encounter for HIV Prophylaxis Measures
When a patient presents for administration of pre-exposure
prophylaxis medication for HIV, assign code Z29.81, Encounter
for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) is intended to prevent infection in people who are at risk
for getting HIV through sex or injection drug use. Any risk
factors for HIV should also be coded.
b. Infectious agents as the cause of diseases classified to other
chapters
Certain infections are classified in chapters other than Chapter 1 and no
organism is identified as part of the infection code. In these instances, it is
necessary to use an additional code from Chapter 1 to identify the organism. A
code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as
the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, B96, Other bacterial agents as
the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, or B97, Viral agents as the
cause of diseases classified to other chapters, is to be used as an additional code
to identify the organism. An instructional note will be found at the infection
code advising that an additional organism code is required.
c. Infections resistant to antibiotics
Many bacterial infections are resistant to current antibiotics. It is necessary to
identify all infections documented as antibiotic resistant. Assign a code from
category Z16, Resistance to antimicrobial drugs, following the infection code
only if the infection code does not identify drug resistance.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 22 of 121

d. Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock Infections resistant to
antibiotics
1) Coding of Sepsis and Severe Sepsis
(a) Sepsis
For a diagnosis of sepsis, assign the appropriate code for the
underlying systemic infection. If the type of infection or causal
organism is not further specified, assign code A41.9, Sepsis,
unspecified organism.
A code from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis, should not be
assigned unless severe sepsis or an associated acute organ
dysfunction is documented.
(i) Negative or inconclusive blood cultures and sepsis
Negative or inconclusive blood cultures do not preclude
a diagnosis of sepsis in patients with clinical evidence of
the condition; however, the provider should be queried.
(ii) Urosepsis
The term urosepsis is a nonspecific term. It is not to be
considered synonymous with sepsis. It has no default
code in the Alphabetic Index. Should a provider use this
term, he/she must be queried for clarification.
(iii) Sepsis with organ dysfunction
If a patient has sepsis and associated acute organ
dysfunction or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD),
follow the instructions for coding severe sepsis.
(iv) Acute organ dysfunction that is not clearly associated
with the sepsis
If a patient has sepsis and an acute organ dysfunction,
but the medical record documentation indicates that the
acute organ dysfunction is related to a medical condition
other than the sepsis, do not assign a code from
subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis. An acute organ
dysfunction must be associated with the sepsis in order to
assign the severe sepsis code. If the documentation is not
clear as to whether an acute organ dysfunction is related
to the sepsis or another medical condition, query the
provider.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 23 of 121

(b) Severe sepsis
The coding of severe sepsis requires a minimum of 2 codes: first
a code for the underlying systemic infection, followed by a code
from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis. If the causal organism is
not documented, assign code A41.9, Sepsis, unspecified
organism, for the infection. Additional code(s) for the associated
acute organ dysfunction are also required.
Due to the complex nature of severe sepsis, some cases may
require querying the provider prior to assignment of the codes.
2) Septic shock
Septic shock generally refers to circulatory failure associated with severe
sepsis, and therefore, it represents a type of acute organ dysfunction.
For cases of septic shock, the code for the systemic infection should be
sequenced first, followed by code R65.21, Severe sepsis with septic
shock or code T81.12, Postprocedural septic shock. Any additional codes
for the other acute organ dysfunctions should also be assigned. As noted
in the sequencing instructions in the Tabular List, the code for septic
shock cannot be assigned as a principal diagnosis.
3) Sequencing of severe sepsis
If severe sepsis is present on admission, and meets the definition of
principal diagnosis, the underlying systemic infection should be assigned
as principal diagnosis followed by the appropriate code from subcategory
R65.2 as required by the sequencing rules in the Tabular List. A code
from subcategory R65.2 can never be assigned as a principal diagnosis.
When severe sepsis develops during an encounter (it was not present on
admission), the underlying systemic infection and the appropriate code
from subcategory R65.2 should be assigned as secondary diagnoses.
Severe sepsis may be present on admission, but the diagnosis may not be
confirmed until sometime after admission. If the documentation is not
clear whether severe sepsis was present on admission, the provider
should be queried.
For infection-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome with severe sepsis,
see guideline I.C.1.d.9.
4) Sepsis or severe sepsis with a localized infection
If the reason for admission is sepsis or severe sepsis and a localized
infection, such as pneumonia or cellulitis, a code(s) for the underlying
systemic infection should be assigned first and the code for the localized
infection should be assigned as a secondary diagnosis. If the patient has
severe sepsis, a code from subcategory R65.2 should also be assigned as
a secondary diagnosis. If the patient is admitted with a localized
infection, such as pneumonia, and sepsis/severe sepsis doesn’t develop
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 24 of 121

until after admission, the localized infection should be assigned first,
followed by the appropriate sepsis/severe sepsis codes.
For hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with sepsis, see guideline
I.C.1.d.9.
5) Sepsis due to a postprocedural infection
(a) Documentation of causal relationship
As with all postprocedural complications, code assignment is
based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship
between the infection and the procedure.
(b) Sepsis due to a postprocedural infection
For sepsis following a postprocedural wound (surgical site)
infection, a code from T81.41 to T81.43, Infection following a
procedure, T81.49, Infection following a procedure, other
surgical site, or a code from O86.00 to O86.03, Infection of
obstetric surgical wound, or code O86.09, Infection of obstetric
surgical wound, other surgical site, that identifies the site of the
infection should be sequenced first, if known. Assign an
additional code for sepsis following a procedure (T81.44) or
sepsis following an obstetrical procedure (O86.04). Use an
additional code to identify the infectious agent. If the patient has
severe sepsis, the appropriate code from subcategory R65.2
should also be assigned with the additional code(s) for any acute
organ dysfunction.
For infections following infusion, transfusion, therapeutic
injection, or immunization, a code from subcategory T80.2,
Infections following infusion, transfusion, and therapeutic
injection, or code T88.0-, Infection following immunization,
should be coded first, followed by the code for the specific
infection. If the patient has severe sepsis, the appropriate code
from subcategory R65.2 should also be assigned, with the
additional codes(s) for any acute organ dysfunction.
(c) Postprocedural infection and postprocedural septic shock
If a postprocedural infection has resulted in postprocedural septic
shock, assign the codes indicated above for sepsis due to a
postprocedural infection, followed by code T81.12-,
Postprocedural septic shock. Do not assign code R65.21, Severe
sepsis with septic shock. Additional code(s) should be assigned
for any acute organ dysfunction.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 25 of 121

6) Sepsis and severe sepsis associated with a noninfectious process
(condition)
In some cases, a noninfectious process (condition) such as trauma, may
lead to an infection which can result in sepsis or severe sepsis. If sepsis
or severe sepsis is documented as associated with a noninfectious
condition, such as a burn or serious injury, and this condition meets the
definition for principal diagnosis, the code for the noninfectious
condition should be sequenced first, followed by the code for the
resulting infection. If severe sepsis is present, a code from subcategory
R65.2 should also be assigned with any associated organ dysfunction(s)
codes. It is not necessary to assign a code from subcategory R65.1,
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious
origin, for these cases.
If the infection meets the definition of principal diagnosis, it should be
sequenced before the non-infectious condition. When both the associated
non-infectious condition and the infection meet the definition of
principal diagnosis, either may be assigned as principal diagnosis.
Only one code from category R65, Symptoms and signs specifically
associated with systemic inflammation and infection, should be assigned.
Therefore, when a non-infectious condition leads to an infection
resulting in severe sepsis, assign the appropriate code from subcategory
R65.2, Severe sepsis. Do not additionally assign a code from subcategory
R65.1, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-
infectious origin.
See Section I.C.18. SIRS due to non-infectious process
7) Sepsis and septic shock complicating abortion, pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium
See Section I.C.15. Sepsis and septic shock complicating abortion,
pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
8) Newborn sepsis
See Section I.C.16. f. Bacterial sepsis of Newborn
9) Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with sepsis
If the reason for admission is hemolytic-uremic syndrome that is
associated with sepsis, assign code D59.31, Infection-associated
hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as the principal diagnosis. Codes for the
underlying systemic infection and any other conditions (such as severe
sepsis) should be assigned as secondary diagnoses.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 26 of 121

e. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Conditions
1) Selection and sequencing of MRSA codes
(a) Combination codes for MRSA infection
When a patient is diagnosed with an infection that is due to
methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and that
infection has a combination code that includes the causal
organism (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia) assign the appropriate
combination code for the condition (e.g., code A41.02, Sepsis
due to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or code
J15.212, Pneumonia due to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus). Do not assign code B95.62, Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases
classified elsewhere, as an additional code, because the
combination code includes the type of infection and the MRSA
organism. Do not assign a code from subcategory Z16.11,
Resistance to penicillins, as an additional diagnosis.
See Section C.1. for instructions on coding and sequencing of
sepsis and severe sepsis.
(b) Other codes for MRSA infection
When there is documentation of a current infection (e.g., wound
infection, stitch abscess, urinary tract infection) due to MRSA, and
that infection does not have a combination code that includes the
causal organism, assign the appropriate code to identify the
condition along with code B95.62, Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified
elsewhere for the MRSA infection. Do not assign a code from
subcategory Z16.11, Resistance to penicillins.
(c) Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and
MRSA colonization
The condition or state of being colonized or carrying MSSA or
MRSA is called colonization or carriage, while an individual
person is described as being colonized or being a carrier.
Colonization means that MSSA or MSRA is present on or in the
body without necessarily causing illness. A positive MRSA
colonization test might be documented by the provider as
“MRSA screen positive” or “MRSA nasal swab positive”.
Assign code Z22.322, Carrier or suspected carrier of Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, for patients documented as
having MRSA colonization. Assign code Z22.321, Carrier or
suspected carrier of Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus
aureus, for patients documented as having MSSA colonization.
Colonization is not necessarily indicative of a disease process or
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 27 of 121

as the cause of a specific condition the patient may have unless
documented as such by the provider.
(d) MRSA colonization and infection
If a patient is documented as having both MRSA colonization and
infection during a hospital admission, code Z22.322, Carrier or
suspected carrier of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and
a code for the MRSA infection may both be assigned.
f. Zika virus infections
1) Code only confirmed cases
Code only a confirmed diagnosis of Zika virus (A92.5, Zika virus
disease) as documented by the provider. This is an exception to the
hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H. In this context, “confirmation”
does not require documentation of the type of test performed; the
provider’s diagnostic statement that the condition is confirmed is
sufficient. This code should be assigned regardless of the stated mode of
transmission.
If the provider documents "suspected", "possible" or "probable" Zika, do
not assign code A92.5. Assign a code(s) explaining the reason for
encounter (such as fever, rash, or joint pain) or Z20.821, Contact with
and (suspected) exposure to Zika virus.
g. Coronavirus infections
1) COVID-19 infection (infection due to SARS-CoV-2)
(a) Code only confirmed cases
Code only a confirmed diagnosis of the 2019 novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) as documented by the provider. For a
confirmed diagnosis, assign code U07.1, COVID-19. This is an
exception to the hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H. In this
context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of a
positive test result for COVID-19; the provider’s documentation
that the individual has COVID-19 is sufficient.
If the provider documents "suspected," "possible," "probable," or
“inconclusive” COVID-19, do not assign code U07.1. Instead,
code the signs and symptoms reported. See guideline I.C.1.g.1.g.
(b) Sequencing of codes
When COVID-19 meets the definition of principal diagnosis, code
U07.1, COVID-19, should be sequenced first, followed by the
appropriate codes for associated manifestations, except when
another guideline requires that certain codes be sequenced first,
such as obstetrics, sepsis, or transplant complications.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 28 of 121

For a COVID-19 infection that progresses to sepsis, see Section
I.C.1.d. Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock
See Section I.C.15.s. for COVID-19 infection in pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium
See Section I.C.16.h. for COVID-19 infection in newborn
For a COVID-19 infection in a lung transplant patient, see
Section I.C.19.g.3.a. Transplant complications other than kidney.
(c) Acute respiratory manifestations of COVID-19
When the reason for the encounter/admission is a respiratory
manifestation of COVID-19, assign code U07.1, COVID-19, as
the principal/first-listed diagnosis and assign code(s) for the
respiratory manifestation(s) as additional diagnoses.
The following conditions are examples of common respiratory
manifestations of COVID-19.
(i) Pneumonia
For a patient with pneumonia confirmed as due to
COVID-19, assign codes U07.1, COVID-19, and J12.82,
Pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019.
(ii) Acute bronchitis
For a patient with acute bronchitis confirmed as due to
COVID-19, assign codes U07.1, and J20.8, Acute
bronchitis due to other specified organisms.
Bronchitis not otherwise specified (NOS) due to COVID-
19 should be coded using code U07.1 and J40, Bronchitis,
not specified as acute or chronic.
(iii)Lower respiratory infection
If the COVID-19 is documented as being associated with
a lower respiratory infection, not otherwise specified
(NOS), or an acute respiratory infection, NOS, codes
U07.1 and J22, Unspecified acute lower respiratory
infection, should be assigned.
If the COVID-19 is documented as being associated with
a respiratory infection, NOS, codes U07.1 and J98.8,
Other specified respiratory disorders, should be assigned.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 29 of 121

(iv) Acute respiratory distress syndrome
For acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to
COVID-19, assign codes U07.1, and J80, Acute
respiratory distress syndrome.
(v) Acute respiratory failure
For acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, assign
code U07.1, and code J96.0-, Acute respiratory failure.
(d) Non-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19
When the reason for the encounter/admission is a non-
respiratory manifestation (e.g., viral enteritis) of COVID-19,
assign code U07.1, COVID-19, as the principal/first-listed
diagnosis and assign code(s) for the manifestation(s) as
additional diagnoses.
(e) Exposure to COVID-19
For asymptomatic individuals with actual or suspected exposure
to COVID-19, assign code Z20.822, Contact with and
(suspected) exposure to COVID-19.
For symptomatic individuals with actual or suspected exposure
to COVID-19 and the infection has been ruled out, or test results
are inconclusive or unknown, assign code Z20.822, Contact with
and (suspected) exposure to COVID-19. See guideline
I.C.21.c.1, Contact/Exposure, for additional guidance regarding
the use of category Z20 codes.
If COVID-19 is confirmed, see guideline I.C.1.g.1.a.
(f) Screening for COVID-19
For screening for COVID-19, including preoperative testing,
assign code Z11.52, Encounter for screening for COVID-19.
(g) Signs and symptoms without definitive diagnosis of COVID-
19
For patients presenting with any signs/symptoms associated with
COVID-19 (such as fever, etc.) but a definitive diagnosis has not
been established, assign the appropriate code(s) for each of the
presenting signs and symptoms such as:
• R05.1, Acute cough, or R05.9, Cough, unspecified
• R06.02 Shortness of breath
• R50.9 Fever, unspecified
If a patient with signs/symptoms associated with COVID-19
also has an actual or suspected contact with or exposure to
COVID-19, assign Z20.822, Contact with and (suspected)
exposure to COVID-19, as an additional code.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 30 of 121

(h) Asymptomatic individuals who test positive for COVID-19
For asymptomatic individuals who test positive for COVID-19
and there is no provider documentation of a diagnosis of
COVID-19, query the provider as to whether or not the
individual has COVID-19. A false positive laboratory test is
possible, and it is the provider’s responsibility to confirm the
diagnosis and document accordingly.
(i) Personal history of COVID-19
For patients with a history of COVID-19, assign code Z86.16,
Personal history of COVID-19.
(j) Follow-up visits after COVID-19 infection has resolved
For individuals who previously had COVID-19, without residual
symptom(s) or condition(s), and are being seen for follow-up
evaluation, and COVID-19 test results are negative, assign codes
Z09, Encounter for follow-up examination after completed
treatment for conditions other than malignant neoplasm, and
Z86.16, Personal history of COVID-19.
For follow-up visits for individuals with symptom(s) or
condition(s) related to a previous COVID-19 infection, see
guideline I.C.1.g.1.m.
See Section I.C.21.c.8, Factors influencing health states and
contact with health services, Follow-up
(k) Encounter for antibody testing
For an encounter for antibody testing that is not being performed
to confirm a current COVID-19 infection, nor is a follow-up test
after resolution of COVID-19, assign Z01.84, Encounter for
antibody response examination.
Follow the applicable guidelines above if the individual is being
tested to confirm a current COVID-19 infection.
For follow-up testing after a COVID-19 infection, see guideline
I.C.1.g.1.j.
(l) Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
For individuals with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS)
and COVID-19, assign code U07.1, COVID-19, as the
principal/first-listed diagnosis and assign code M35.81,
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, as an additional diagnosis.
If an individual with a history of COVID-19 develops MIS,
assign codes M35.81, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and
U09.9, Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 31 of 121

If an individual with a known or suspected exposure to COVID-
19, and no current COVID-19 infection or history of COVID-19,
develops MIS, assign codes M35.81, Multisystem inflammatory
syndrome, and Z20.822, Contact with and (suspected) exposure
to COVID-19.
Additional codes should be assigned for any associated
complications of MIS.
(m) Post COVID-19 Condition
For sequela of COVID-19, or associated symptoms or
conditions that develop following a previous COVID-19
infection, assign a code(s) for the specific symptom(s) or
condition(s) related to the previous COVID-19 infection, if
known, and code U09.9, Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified.
Code U09.9 should not be assigned for manifestations of an
active (current) COVID-19 infection.
If a patient has a condition(s) associated with a previous
COVID-19 infection and develops a new active (current)
COVID-19 infection, code U09.9 may be assigned in
conjunction with code U07.1, COVID-19, to identify that the
patient also has a condition(s) associated with a previous
COVID-19 infection. Code(s) for the specific condition(s)
associated with the previous COVID-19 infection and code(s)
for manifestation(s) of the new active (current) COVID-19
infection should also be assigned.
(n) Underimmunization for COVID-19 Status
Code Z28.310, Unvaccinated for COVID-19, may be assigned
when the patient has not received a COVID-19 vaccine of any
type. Code Z28.311, Partially vaccinated for COVID-19, may be
assigned when the patient has been partially vaccinated for
COVID-19 as per the recommendations of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in place at the time of
the encounter. For information, visit the CDC’s website
https://www.cdc.gov/covidschedule.
See Section I.B.14. for underimmunization documentation by
clinicians other than patient's provider.
2. Chapter 2: Neoplasms (C00-D49)
General Guidelines
Chapter 2 of the ICD-10-CM contains the codes for most benign and all malignant
neoplasms. Certain benign neoplasms, such as prostatic adenomas, may be found in the
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 32 of 121

specific body system chapters. To properly code a neoplasm, it is necessary to
determine from the record if the neoplasm is benign, in-situ, malignant, or of uncertain
histologic behavior. If malignant, any secondary (metastatic) sites should also be
determined.
Primary malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries
A primary malignant neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous (next to each
other) sites should be classified to the subcategory/code .8 ('overlapping lesion'),
unless the combination is specifically indexed elsewhere. For multiple neoplasms of
the same site that are not contiguous such as tumors in different quadrants of the
same breast, codes for each site should be assigned.
Malignant neoplasm of ectopic tissue
Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site of origin
mentioned, e.g., ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms involving the stomach are
coded to malignant neoplasm of pancreas, unspecified (C25.9).
The neoplasm table in the Alphabetic Index should be referenced first. However, if the
histological term is documented, that term should be referenced first, rather than going
immediately to the Neoplasm Table, in order to determine which column in the
Neoplasm Table is appropriate. For example, if the documentation indicates “adenoma,”
refer to the term in the Alphabetic Index to review the entries under this term and the
instructional note to “see also neoplasm, by site, benign.” The table provides the proper
code based on the type of neoplasm and the site. It is important to select the proper
column in the table that corresponds to the type of neoplasm. The Tabular List should
then be referenced to verify that the correct code has been selected from the table and
that a more specific site code does not exist.
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health services,
Status, for information regarding Z15.0, codes for genetic susceptibility to cancer.
a. Admission/Encounter for treatment of primary site
If the malignancy is chiefly responsible for occasioning the patient
admission/encounter and treatment is directed at the primary site, designate the
primary malignancy as the principal/first-listed diagnosis.
The only exception to this guideline is if the administration of chemotherapy,
immunotherapy or external beam radiation therapy is chiefly responsible for
occasioning the admission/encounter. In that case, assign the appropriate Z51.--
code as the first-listed or principal diagnosis, and the underlying diagnosis or
problem for which the service is being performed as a secondary diagnosis.
b. Admission/Encounter for treatment of secondary site
When a patient is admitted because of a primary neoplasm with metastasis and
treatment is directed toward the secondary site only, the secondary neoplasm is
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 33 of 121

designated as the principal diagnosis even though the primary malignancy is still
present.
c. Coding and sequencing of complications
Coding and sequencing of complications associated with the malignancies or
with the therapy thereof are subject to the following guidelines:
1) Anemia associated with malignancy
When admission/encounter is for management of an anemia associated
with the malignancy, and the treatment is only for anemia, the
appropriate code for the malignancy is sequenced as the principal or
first-listed diagnosis followed by the appropriate code for the anemia
(such as code D63.0, Anemia in neoplastic disease).
2) Anemia associated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and
radiation therapy
When the admission/encounter is for management of an anemia
associated with an adverse effect of the administration of chemotherapy
or immunotherapy and the only treatment is for the anemia, the anemia
code is sequenced first followed by the appropriate codes for the
neoplasm and the adverse effect (T45.1X5-, Adverse effect of
antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs).
When the admission/encounter is for management of an anemia
associated with an adverse effect of radiotherapy, the anemia code
should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate neoplasm code
and code Y84.2, Radiological procedure and radiotherapy as the cause of
abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without
mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure.
3) Management of dehydration due to the malignancy
When the admission/encounter is for management of dehydration due to
the malignancy and only the dehydration is being treated (intravenous
rehydration), the dehydration is sequenced first, followed by the code(s)
for the malignancy.
4) Treatment of a complication resulting from a surgical
procedure
When the admission/encounter is for treatment of a complication
resulting from a surgical procedure, designate the complication as the
principal or first-listed diagnosis if treatment is directed at resolving the
complication.
d. Primary malignancy previously excised
When a primary malignancy has been previously excised or eradicated from its
site and there is no further treatment directed to that site and there is no evidence
of any existing primary malignancy at that site, a code from category Z85,
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 34 of 121

Personal history of malignant neoplasm, should be used to indicate the former
site of the malignancy. Any mention of extension, invasion, or metastasis to
another site is coded as a secondary malignant neoplasm to that site. The
secondary site may be the principal or first-listed diagnosis with the Z85 code
used as a secondary code.
See section I.C.2.t. Secondary malignant neoplasm of lymphoid tissue.
e. Admissions/Encounters involving antineoplastic chemotherapy,
immunotherapy and radiation therapy
1) Episode of care involves surgical removal of neoplasm
When an episode of care involves the surgical removal of a neoplasm,
primary or secondary site, followed by adjunct chemotherapy or
radiation treatment during the same episode of care, the code for the
neoplasm should be assigned as principal or first-listed diagnosis.
2) Patient admission/encounter chiefly for administration of
antineoplastic chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation
therapy
If a patient admission/encounter is chiefly for the administration of
chemotherapy, immunotherapy or external beam radiation therapy for
the treatment of a neoplasm, assign code Z51.0, Encounter for
antineoplastic radiation therapy, or Z51.11, Encounter for antineoplastic
chemotherapy, or Z51.12, Encounter for antineoplastic immunotherapy
as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. If the reason for the encounter
is more than one type of antineoplastic therapy, code Z51.0 and
codes from subcategory Z51.1 may be assigned together, in which
case one of these codes would be reported as a secondary diagnosis.
The malignancy for which the therapy is being administered should be
assigned as a secondary diagnosis.
If a patient admission/encounter is for the insertion or implantation of
radioactive elements (e.g., brachytherapy) the appropriate code for the
malignancy is sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis. Code
Z51.0 should not be assigned.
3) Patient admitted for radiation therapy, chemotherapy or
immunotherapy and develops complications
When a patient is admitted for the purpose of external beam
radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy and develops
complications such as uncontrolled nausea and vomiting or dehydration,
the principal or first-listed diagnosis is Z51.0, Encounter for
antineoplastic radiation therapy, or Z51.11, Encounter for antineoplastic
chemotherapy, or Z51.12, Encounter for antineoplastic immunotherapy
followed by any codes for the complications.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 35 of 121

When a patient is admitted for the purpose of insertion or implantation of
radioactive elements (e.g., brachytherapy) and develops complications
such as uncontrolled nausea and vomiting or dehydration, the principal
or first-listed diagnosis is the appropriate code for the malignancy
followed by any codes for the complications.
f. Admission/encounter to determine extent of malignancy
When the reason for admission/encounter is to determine the extent of the
malignancy, or for a procedure such as paracentesis or thoracentesis, the primary
malignancy or appropriate metastatic site is designated as the principal or
first-listed diagnosis, even though chemotherapy or radiotherapy is
administered.
g. Symptoms, signs, and abnormal findings listed in Chapter 18
associated with neoplasms
Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions listed in Chapter 18 characteristic
of, or associated with, an existing primary or secondary site malignancy cannot
be used to replace the malignancy as principal or first-listed diagnosis,
regardless of the number of admissions or encounters for treatment and care of
the neoplasm.
See section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, Encounter for prophylactic organ removal.
h. Admission/encounter for pain control/management
See Section I.C.6. for information on coding admission/encounter for pain
control/management.
i. Malignancy in two or more noncontiguous sites
A patient may have more than one malignant tumor in the same organ. These
tumors may represent different primaries or metastatic disease, depending on the
site. Should the documentation be unclear, the provider should be queried as to
the status of each tumor so that the correct codes can be assigned.
j. Disseminated malignant neoplasm, unspecified
Code C80.0, Disseminated malignant neoplasm, unspecified, is for use only in
those cases where the patient has advanced metastatic disease and no known
primary or secondary sites are specified. It should not be used in place of
assigning codes for the primary site and all known secondary sites.
k. Malignant neoplasm without specification of site
Code C80.1, Malignant (primary) neoplasm, unspecified, equates to Cancer,
unspecified. This code should only be used when no determination can be made
as to the primary site of a malignancy. This code should rarely be used in the
inpatient setting.

l. Sequencing of neoplasm codes
1) Encounter for treatment of primary malignancy
If the reason for the encounter is for treatment of a primary malignancy,
assign the malignancy as the principal/first-listed diagnosis. The primary
site is to be sequenced first, followed by any metastatic sites.
2) Encounter for treatment of secondary malignancy
When an encounter is for a primary malignancy with metastasis and
treatment is directed toward the metastatic (secondary) site(s) only, the
metastatic site(s) is designated as the principal/first-listed diagnosis. The
primary malignancy is coded as an additional code.
3) Malignant neoplasm in a pregnant patient
When a pregnant patient has a malignant neoplasm, a code from
subcategory O9A.1-, Malignant neoplasm complicating pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium, should be sequenced first, followed by
the appropriate code from Chapter 2 to indicate the type of neoplasm.
4) Encounter for complication associated with a neoplasm
When an encounter is for management of a complication associated with
a neoplasm, such as dehydration, and the treatment is only for the
complication, the complication is coded first, followed by the appropriate
code(s) for the neoplasm.
The exception to this guideline is anemia. When the admission/encounter
is for management of an anemia associated with the malignancy, and the
treatment is only for anemia, the appropriate code for the malignancy is
sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis followed by code
D63.0, Anemia in neoplastic disease.
5) Complication from surgical procedure for treatment of a
neoplasm
When an encounter is for treatment of a complication resulting from a
surgical procedure performed for the treatment of the neoplasm,
designate the complication as the principal/first-listed diagnosis. See the
guideline regarding the coding of a current malignancy versus personal
history to determine if the code for the neoplasm should also be assigned.
6) Pathologic fracture due to a neoplasm
When an encounter is for a pathological fracture due to a neoplasm, and
the focus of treatment is the fracture, a code from subcategory M84.5,
Pathological fracture in neoplastic disease, should be sequenced first,
followed by the code for the neoplasm.
If the focus of treatment is the neoplasm with an associated pathological
fracture, the neoplasm code should be sequenced first, followed by a
code from M84.5 for the pathological fracture.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 37 of 121

m. Current malignancy versus personal history of malignancy
When a primary malignancy has been excised but further treatment, such as an
additional surgery for the malignancy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy is
directed to that site, the primary malignancy code should be used until treatment
is completed.
When a primary malignancy has been previously excised or eradicated from its
site, there is no further treatment (of the malignancy) directed to that site, and
there is no evidence of any existing primary malignancy at that site, a code from
category Z85, Personal history of malignant neoplasm, should be used to
indicate the former site of the malignancy.
Codes from subcategories Z85.0 – Z85.85 should only be assigned for the
former site of a primary malignancy, not the site of a secondary malignancy.
Code Z85.89 may be assigned for the former site(s) of either a primary or
secondary malignancy.
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, History (of)
n. Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, and Malignant Plasma Cell
Neoplasms in remission versus personal history
The categories for leukemia, and category C90, Multiple myeloma and
malignant plasma cell neoplasms, have codes indicating whether or not the
leukemia has achieved remission. There are also codes Z85.6, Personal history
of leukemia, and Z85.79, Personal history of other malignant neoplasms of
lymphoid, hematopoietic and related tissues. If the documentation is unclear as
to whether the leukemia has achieved remission, the provider should be queried.
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, History (of)
o. Aftercare following surgery for neoplasm
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, Aftercare
p. Follow-up care for completed treatment of a malignancy
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, Follow-up
q. Prophylactic organ removal for prevention of malignancy
See Section I.C. 21, Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, Prophylactic organ removal
r. Malignant neoplasm associated with transplanted organ
A malignant neoplasm of a transplanted organ should be coded as a transplant
complication. Assign first the appropriate code from category T86.-,
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 38 of 121

Complications of transplanted organs and tissue, followed by code C80.2,
Malignant neoplasm associated with transplanted organ. Use an additional code
for the specific malignancy.
s. Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
Breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a type
of lymphoma that can develop around breast implants. Assign code C84.7A,
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative, breast, for BIA-ALCL or
C84.7B, Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative, in remission, for BIA-
ALCL in remission. Do not assign a complication code from chapter 19.
t. Secondary malignant neoplasm of lymphoid tissue
When a malignant neoplasm of lymphoid tissue metastasizes beyond the lymph
nodes, a code from categories C81-C85 with a final character identifying
“extranodal and solid organ sites” should be assigned rather than a code for the
secondary neoplasm of the affected solid organ. For example, for metastasis of
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to the lung, brain and left adrenal gland, assign
code C83.398, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of other extranodal and solid
organ sites.

certain disorders involving the immune mechanism (D50-D89)
Reserved for future guideline expansion
4. Chapter 4: Endocrine, Nutritional, and Metabolic Diseases (E00-E89)
a. Diabetes mellitus
The diabetes mellitus codes are combination codes that include the type of
diabetes mellitus, the body system affected, and the complications affecting that
body system. As many codes within a particular category as are necessary to
describe all of the complications of the disease may be used. They should be
sequenced based on the reason for a particular encounter. Assign as many codes
from categories E08 – E13 as needed to identify all of the associated conditions
that the patient has.
1) Type of diabetes
The age of a patient is not the sole determining factor, though most type
1 diabetics develop the condition before reaching puberty. For this
reason, type 1 diabetes mellitus is also referred to as juvenile diabetes.
(a) Presymptomatic Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
Codes E10.A-, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, presymptomatic, are
assigned for early-stage type 1 diabetes that predates the onset of
symptoms.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 39 of 121

(b) Type 2 diabetes mellitus in remission
Code E11.A, Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications
in remission, is assigned based on provider documentation
that the diabetes mellitus is in remission. If the
documentation is unclear as to whether the Type 2 diabetes
mellitus has achieved remission, the provider should be
queried. For example, the term “resolved” is not
synonymous with remission.
2) Type of diabetes mellitus not documented
If the type of diabetes mellitus is not documented in the medical record
the default is E11.-, Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3) Diabetes mellitus and the use of insulin, oral hypoglycemics,
and injectable non-insulin drugs
If the documentation in a medical record does not indicate the type of
diabetes but does indicate that the patient uses insulin, code E11-, Type 2
diabetes mellitus, should be assigned. Additional code(s) should be
assigned from category Z79 to identify the long-term (current) use of
insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs, or injectable non-insulin antidiabetic,
as follows:
If the patient is treated with both oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin,
both code Z79.4, Long term (current) use of insulin, and code Z79.84,
Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, should be assigned.
If the patient is treated with both insulin and an injectable non-insulin
antidiabetic drug, assign codes Z79.4, Long term (current) use of insulin,
and Z79.85, Long-term (current) use of injectable non-insulin
antidiabetic drugs.
If the patient is treated with both oral hypoglycemic drugs and an
injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drug, assign codes Z79.84, Long term
(current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, and Z79.85, Long-term
(current) use of injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drugs.
Code Z79.4 should not be assigned if insulin is given temporarily to
bring a type 2 patient’s blood sugar under control during an encounter.
4) Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and gestational diabetes
See Section I.C.15. Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.
See Section I.C.15. Gestational (pregnancy induced) diabetes
5) Complications due to insulin pump malfunction
(a) Underdose of insulin due to insulin pump failure
An underdose of insulin due to an insulin pump failure should be
assigned to a code from subcategory T85.6, Mechanical
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 40 of 121

complication of other specified internal and external prosthetic
devices, implants and grafts, that specifies the type of pump
malfunction, as the principal or first-listed code, followed by
code T38.3X6-, Underdosing of insulin and oral hypoglycemic
[antidiabetic] drugs. Additional codes for the type of diabetes
mellitus and any associated complications due to the underdosing
should also be assigned.
(b) Overdose of insulin due to insulin pump failure
The principal or first-listed code for an encounter due to an
insulin pump malfunction resulting in an overdose of insulin,
should also be T85.6-, Mechanical complication of other
specified internal and external prosthetic devices, implants and
grafts, followed by code T38.3X1-, Poisoning by insulin and oral
hypoglycemic [antidiabetic] drugs, accidental (unintentional).
6) Secondary diabetes mellitus
Codes under categories E08, Diabetes mellitus due to underlying
condition, E09, Drug or chemical induced diabetes mellitus, and E13,
Other specified diabetes mellitus, identify complications/manifestations
associated with secondary diabetes mellitus. Secondary diabetes is
always caused by another condition or event (e.g., cystic fibrosis,
malignant neoplasm of pancreas, pancreatectomy, adverse effect of drug,
or poisoning).
(a) Secondary diabetes mellitus and the use of insulin, oral
hypoglycemic drugs, or injectable non-insulin drugs
For patients with secondary diabetes mellitus who routinely use
insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs, or injectable non-insulin drugs,
additional code(s) from category Z79 should be assigned to
identify the long-term (current) use of insulin, oral hypoglycemic
drugs, or non-injectable non-insulin drugs as follows:
If the patient is treated with both oral hypoglycemic drugs
and insulin, both code Z79.4, Long term (current) use of
insulin, and code Z79.84, Long term (current) use of oral
hypoglycemic drugs, should be assigned.
If the patient is treated with both insulin and an injectable
non- insulin antidiabetic drug, assign codes Z79.4, Long-
term (current) use of insulin, and Z79.85, Long-term (current)
use of injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drugs.
If the patient is treated with both oral hypoglycemic drugs
and an injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drug, assign codes
Z79.84, Long-term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs,
and Z79.85, Long-term (current) use of injectable non-insulin
antidiabetic drugs.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 41 of 121

Code Z79.4 should not be assigned if insulin is given
temporarily to bring a secondary diabetic patient’s blood
sugar under control during an encounter.
(b) Assigning and sequencing secondary diabetes codes and its
causes
The sequencing of the secondary diabetes codes in relationship to
codes for the cause of the diabetes is based on the Tabular List
instructions for categories E08, E09 and E13.
(i) Secondary diabetes mellitus due to pancreatectomy
For postpancreatectomy diabetes mellitus (lack of insulin
due to the surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas),
assign code E89.1, Postprocedural hypoinsulinemia.
Assign a code from category E13 as the principal or first-
listed diagnosis and a code from subcategory Z90.41,
Acquired absence of pancreas, as an additional code.
(ii) Secondary diabetes due to drugs
Secondary diabetes may be caused by an adverse effect of
correctly administered medications, poisoning or sequela
of poisoning.
See section I.C.19.e. for coding of adverse effects and
poisoning, and section I.C.20 for external cause code
reporting.
b. Obesity
The obesity codes in category E66, Overweight and obesity, include codes
related to the cause of obesity, such as drug-induced obesity (E66.1), and codes
related to effects of obesity, such as code E66.2, Morbid (severe) obesity with
alveolar hypoventilation. There are other codes related to obesity in other
categories of the classification, such as E88.82, Obesity due to disruption of
MC4R pathway; and codes in fifth character subcategory O99.21, Obesity
complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium.
1) Obesity class
The obesity class codes in subcategory E66.81, Obesity class, require a
fifth character to convey the severity of obesity. The obesity class should
be documented in the medical record by the provider for these codes to
be assigned. The obesity class codes can be reported with other obesity
codes in the classification found in Chapters 4 and 15 to fully describe
the condition. However, if both class 3 obesity and morbid obesity are
documented, only a code for class 3 obesity should be assigned as it is
more specific.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 42 of 121

5. Chapter 5: Mental, Behavioral and Neurodevelopmental disorders
(F01 – F99)
a. Pain disorders related to psychological factors
Assign code F45.41, for pain that is exclusively related to psychological
disorders. As indicated by the Excludes 1 note under category G89, a code from
category G89 should not be assigned with code F45.41.
Code F45.42, Pain disorders with related psychological factors, should be used
with a code from category G89, Pain, not elsewhere classified, if there is
documentation of a psychological component for a patient with acute or chronic
pain.
See Section I.C.6. Pain
b. Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance
use
1) In Remission
Selection of codes describing “in remission” for categories F10-F19,
Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use
(categories F10-F19 with -.11, -.21, -.91) requires the provider’s clinical
judgment and are assigned only on the basis of provider documentation
(as defined in the Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting), unless
otherwise instructed by the classification.
Mild substance use disorders in early or sustained remission are
classified to the appropriate codes for substance abuse in remission, and
moderate or severe substance use disorders in early or sustained
remission are classified to the appropriate codes for substance
dependence in remission.
2) Psychoactive Substance Use, Abuse and Dependence
When the provider documentation refers to use, abuse and dependence of
the same substance (e.g. alcohol, opioid, cannabis, etc.), only one code
should be assigned to identify the pattern of use based on the following
hierarchy:
• If both use and abuse are documented, assign only the code for
abuse
• If both abuse and dependence are documented, assign only the code
for dependence
• If use, abuse and dependence are all documented, assign only the
code for dependence
• If both use and dependence are documented, assign only the code
for dependence.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 43 of 121

3) Psychoactive Substance Use, Unspecified
As with all other unspecified diagnoses, the codes for unspecified
psychoactive substance use (F10.9-, F11.9-, F12.9-, F13.9-, F14.9-,
F15.9-, F16.9-, F18.9-, F19.9-) should only be assigned based on
provider documentation and when they meet the definition of a
reportable diagnosis (see Section III, Reporting Additional Diagnoses).
These codes are to be used only when the psychoactive substance use is
associated with a substance related disorder (chapter 5 disorders such as
sexual dysfunction, sleep disorder, or a mental or behavioral disorder) or
medical condition, and such a relationship is documented by the
provider.
4) Medical Conditions Due to Psychoactive Substance Use, Abuse
and Dependence
Medical conditions due to substance use, abuse, and dependence are not
classified as substance-induced disorders. Assign the diagnosis code for
the medical condition as directed by the Alphabetical Index along with
the appropriate psychoactive substance use, abuse or dependence code.
For example, for alcoholic pancreatitis due to alcohol dependence, assign
the appropriate code from subcategory K85.2, Alcohol induced acute
pancreatitis, and the appropriate code from subcategory F10.2, such as
code F10.20, Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated. It would not be
appropriate to assign code F10.288, Alcohol dependence with other
alcohol-induced disorder.
5) Blood Alcohol Level
A code from category Y90, Evidence of alcohol involvement determined
by blood alcohol level, may be assigned when this information is
documented and the patient’s provider has documented a condition
classifiable to category F10, Alcohol related disorders. The blood alcohol
level does not need to be documented by the patient’s provider in order
for it to be coded.
See Section I.B.14. for blood alcohol level documentation by
clinicians other than patient's provider.
c. Factitious Disorder
Factitious disorder imposed on self or Munchausen’s syndrome is a disorder in
which a person falsely reports or causes his or her own physical or psychological
signs or symptoms. For patients with documented factitious disorder on self or
Munchausen’s syndrome, assign the appropriate code from subcategory F68.1-,
Factitious disorder imposed on self.
Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a disorder in which a caregiver
(perpetrator) falsely reports or causes an illness or injury in another person
(victim) under his or her care, such as a child, an elderly adult, or a person who
has a disability. The condition is also referred to as “factitious disorder imposed
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 44 of 121

on another” or “factitious disorder by proxy.” The perpetrator, not the victim,
receives this diagnosis. Assign code F68.A, Factitious disorder imposed on
another, to the perpetrator’s record. For the victim of a patient suffering from
MSBP, assign the appropriate code from categories T74, Adult and child abuse,
neglect and other maltreatment, confirmed, or T76, Adult and child abuse,
neglect and other maltreatment, suspected.
See Section I.C.19.f. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment
d. Dementia
The ICD-10-CM classifies dementia (categories F01, F02, and F03) on the basis
of the etiology and severity (unspecified, mild, moderate or severe). Selection of
the appropriate severity level requires the provider’s clinical judgment and codes
should be assigned only on the basis of provider documentation (as defined in the
Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting), unless otherwise instructed by the
classification. If the documentation does not provide information about the
severity of the dementia, assign the appropriate code for unspecified severity.
If a patient is admitted to an inpatient acute care hospital or other inpatient
facility setting with dementia at one severity level and it progresses to a higher
severity level, assign one code for the highest severity level reported during the
stay.
6. Chapter 6: Diseases of the Nervous System (G00-G99)
a. Dominant/nondominant side
Codes from category G81, Hemiplegia and hemiparesis, and subcategories
G83.1, Monoplegia of lower limb, G83.2, Monoplegia of upper limb, and G83.3,
Monoplegia, unspecified, identify whether the dominant or nondominant side is
affected. Should the affected side be documented, but not specified as dominant
or nondominant, and the classification system does not indicate a default, code
selection is as follows:
• For ambidextrous patients, the default should be dominant.
• If the left side is affected, the default is non-dominant.
• If the right side is affected, the default is dominant.
b. Pain - Category G89
1) General coding information
Codes in category G89, Pain, not elsewhere classified, may be used in
conjunction with codes from other categories and chapters to provide
more detail about acute or chronic pain and neoplasm-related pain,
unless otherwise indicated below.
If the pain is not specified as acute or chronic, post-thoracotomy,
postprocedural, or neoplasm-related, do not assign codes from category
G89.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 45 of 121

A code from category G89 should not be assigned if the underlying
(definitive) diagnosis is known, unless the reason for the encounter is
pain control/ management and not management of the underlying
condition.
When an admission or encounter is for a procedure aimed at treating the
underlying condition (e.g., spinal fusion, kyphoplasty), a code for the
underlying condition (e.g., vertebral fracture, spinal stenosis) should be
assigned as the principal diagnosis. No code from category G89 should
be assigned.
(a) Category G89 Codes as Principal or First-Listed Diagnosis
Category G89 codes are acceptable as principal diagnosis or the
first-listed code:
• When pain control or pain management is the reason for the
admission/encounter (e.g., a patient with displaced
intervertebral disc, nerve impingement and severe back pain
presents for injection of steroid into the spinal canal). The
underlying cause of the pain should be reported as an
additional diagnosis, if known.
• When a patient is admitted for the insertion of a
neurostimulator for pain control, assign the appropriate pain
code as the principal or first-listed diagnosis. When an
admission or encounter is for a procedure aimed at treating
the underlying condition and a neurostimulator is inserted for
pain control during the same admission/encounter, a code for
the underlying condition should be assigned as the principal
diagnosis and the appropriate pain code should be assigned as
a secondary diagnosis.
(b) Use of Category G89 Codes in Conjunction with Site Specific
Pain Codes
(i) Assigning Category G89 and Site-Specific Pain Codes
Codes from category G89 may be used in conjunction
with codes that identify the site of pain (including codes
from chapter 18) if the category G89 code provides
additional information. For example, if the code describes
the site of the pain, but does not fully describe whether
the pain is acute or chronic, then both codes should be
assigned.
(ii) Sequencing of Category G89 Codes with Site-Specific
Pain Codes
The sequencing of category G89 codes with site- specific
pain codes (including chapter 18 codes), is dependent on
the circumstances of the encounter/admission as follows:
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 46 of 121

• If the encounter is for pain control or pain
management, assign the code from category G89
followed by the code identifying the specific site
of pain (e.g., encounter for pain management for
acute neck pain from trauma is assigned code
G89.11, Acute pain due to trauma, followed by
code M54.2, Cervicalgia, to identify the site of
pain).
• If the encounter is for any other reason except pain
control or pain management, and a related
definitive diagnosis has not been established
(confirmed) by the provider, assign the code for
the specific site of pain first, followed by the
appropriate code from category G89.
2) Pain due to devices, implants and grafts
See Section I.C.19. Pain due to medical devices
3) Postoperative Pain
The provider’s documentation should be used to guide the coding of
postoperative pain, as well as Section III. Reporting Additional
Diagnoses and Section IV. Diagnostic Coding and Reporting in the
Outpatient Setting.
The default for post-thoracotomy and other postoperative pain not
specified as acute or chronic is the code for the acute form.
Routine or expected postoperative pain immediately after surgery should
not be coded.
(a) Postoperative pain not associated with specific postoperative
complication
Postoperative pain not associated with a specific postoperative
complication is assigned to the appropriate postoperative pain
code in category G89.
(b) Postoperative pain associated with specific postoperative
complication
Postoperative pain associated with a specific postoperative
complication (such as painful wire sutures) is assigned to the
appropriate code(s) found in Chapter 19, Injury, poisoning, and
certain other consequences of external causes. If appropriate, use
additional code(s) from category G89 to identify acute or chronic
pain (G89.18 or G89.28).
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 47 of 121

4) Chronic pain
Chronic pain is classified to subcategory G89.2. There is no time frame
defining when pain becomes chronic pain. The provider’s documentation
should be used to guide use of these codes.
5) Neoplasm Related Pain
Code G89.3 is assigned to pain documented as being related, associated
or due to cancer, primary or secondary malignancy, or tumor. This code
is assigned regardless of whether the pain is acute or chronic.
This code may be assigned as the principal or first-listed code when the
stated reason for the admission/encounter is documented as pain
control/pain management. The underlying neoplasm should be reported
as an additional diagnosis.
When the reason for the admission/encounter is management of the
neoplasm and the pain associated with the neoplasm is also documented,
code G89.3 may be assigned as an additional diagnosis. It is not
necessary to assign an additional code for the site of the pain.
See Section I.C.2. for instructions on the sequencing of neoplasms for all
other stated reasons for the admission/encounter (except for pain
control/pain management).
6) Chronic pain syndrome
Central pain syndrome (G89.0) and chronic pain syndrome (G89.4) are
different than the term “chronic pain,” and therefore codes should only
be used when the provider has specifically documented this condition.
See Section I.C.5. Pain disorders related to psychological factors
7. Chapter 7: Diseases of the Eye and Adnexa (H00-H59)
a. Glaucoma
1) Assigning Glaucoma Codes
Assign as many codes from category H40, Glaucoma, as needed to
identify the type of glaucoma, the affected eye, and the glaucoma stage.
2) Bilateral glaucoma with same type and stage
When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and both eyes are documented as
being the same type and stage, and there is a code for bilateral glaucoma,
report only the code for the type of glaucoma, bilateral, with the seventh
character for the stage.
When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and both eyes are documented as
being the same type and stage, and the classification does not provide a
code for bilateral glaucoma (i.e. subcategories H40.10, and H40.20)
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 48 of 121

report only one code for the type of glaucoma with the appropriate
seventh character for the stage.
3) Bilateral glaucoma stage with different types or stages
When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and each eye is documented as
having a different type or stage, and the classification distinguishes
laterality, assign the appropriate code for each eye rather than the code
for bilateral glaucoma.
When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and each eye is documented as
having a different type, and the classification does not distinguish
laterality (i.e., subcategories H40.10, and H40.20), assign one code for
each type of glaucoma with the appropriate seventh character for the
stage.
When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and each eye is documented as
having the same type, but different stage, and the classification does not
distinguish laterality (i.e., subcategories H40.10 and H40.20), assign a
code for the type of glaucoma for each eye with the seventh character for
the specific glaucoma stage documented for each eye.
4) Patient admitted with glaucoma and stage evolves during the
admission
If a patient is admitted with glaucoma and the stage progresses during
the admission, assign the code for highest stage documented.
5) Indeterminate stage glaucoma
Assignment of the seventh character “4” for “indeterminate stage”
should be based on the clinical documentation. The seventh character “4”
is used for glaucomas whose stage cannot be clinically determined. This
seventh character should not be confused with the seventh character “0”,
unspecified, which should be assigned when there is no documentation
regarding the stage of the glaucoma.
b. Blindness
If “blindness” or “low vision” of both eyes is documented but the visual
impairment category is not documented, assign code H54.3, Unqualified visual
loss, both eyes. If “blindness” or “low vision” in one eye is documented but the
visual impairment category is not documented, assign a code from H54.6-,
Unqualified visual loss, one eye. If “blindness” or “visual loss” is documented
without any information about whether one or both eyes are affected, assign
code H54.7, Unspecified visual loss.

9. Chapter 9: Diseases of the Circulatory System (I00-I99)
a. Hypertension
The classification presumes a causal relationship between hypertension and heart
involvement and between hypertension and kidney involvement, as the two
conditions are linked by the term “with” in the Alphabetic Index. These
conditions should be coded as related even in the absence of provider
documentation explicitly linking them, unless the documentation clearly states
the conditions are unrelated.
For hypertension and conditions not specifically linked by relational terms such
as “with,” “associated with” or “due to” in the classification, provider
documentation must link the conditions in order to code them as related.
1) Hypertension with Heart Disease
Hypertension with heart conditions classified to I50.-, Heart failure,
I51.4, Myocarditis, unspecified, I51.89, Other ill-defined heart
diseases, and I51.9, Heart disease, unspecified, is assigned to a code
from category I11, Hypertensive heart disease. Use additional
code(s) from category I50, Heart failure, or I51, Complications and
ill-defined descriptions of heart disease, to identify the heart
condition.
Hypertension with heart conditions classified to I51.5, Myocardial
degeneration, or I51.7, Cardiomegaly, is assigned to a code from
category I11, Hypertensive heart disease. No additional code is
assigned to identify the specific heart condition.
The same heart conditions (I50.-, I51.4-I51.7, I51.89, I51.9) with
hypertension are coded separately if the provider has documented they
are unrelated to the hypertension. The applicable hypertension code
I10, Essential (primary) hypertension, or a code from category I15,
Secondary hypertension, should be assigned. Sequence according to
the circumstances of the admission/encounter.
2) Hypertensive Chronic Kidney Disease
Assign codes from category I12, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease,
when both hypertension and a condition classifiable to category N18,
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), are present. CKD should not be coded as
hypertensive if the provider indicates the CKD is not related to the
hypertension.
The appropriate code from category N18 should be used as a secondary
code with a code from category I12 to identify the stage of chronic
kidney disease.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 50 of 121

See Section I.C.14. Chronic kidney disease.
If a patient has hypertensive chronic kidney disease and acute renal
failure, the acute renal failure should also be coded. Sequence according
to the circumstances of the admission/encounter.
3) Hypertensive Heart and Chronic Kidney Disease
The codes in category I13, Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney
disease, are combination codes that include hypertension, heart disease
and chronic kidney disease. Assign codes from combination category
I13, Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease, when there is
hypertension with both heart and chronic kidney disease. If heart failure
is present, assign an additional code from category I50 to identify the
type of heart failure.
The appropriate code from category N18, Chronic kidney disease, should
be used as a secondary code with a code from category I13 to identify
the stage of chronic kidney disease.
See Section I.C.14. Chronic kidney disease.
The Includes note at I13 specifies that the conditions included at I11 and
I12 are included together in I13. If a patient has hypertension, heart
disease and chronic kidney disease, then a code from I13 should be used,
not codes from I11 or I12,
For patients with both acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease, the
acute renal failure should also be coded. Sequence according to the
circumstances of the admission/encounter.
4) Hypertensive Cerebrovascular Disease
For hypertensive cerebrovascular disease, first assign the appropriate
code from categories I60-I69, followed by the appropriate hypertension
code.
5) Hypertensive Retinopathy
Subcategory H35.0, Background retinopathy and retinal vascular
changes, should be used along with a code from categories I10 – I15, in
the Hypertensive diseases section, to include the systemic hypertension.
The sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter.
6) Hypertension, Secondary
Secondary hypertension is due to an underlying condition. Two codes are
required: one to identify the underlying etiology and one from category
I15 to identify the hypertension. Sequencing of codes is determined by
the reason for admission/encounter.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 51 of 121

7) Hypertension, Transient
Assign code R03.0, Elevated blood pressure reading without diagnosis of
hypertension, unless patient has an established diagnosis of hypertension.
Assign code O13.-, Gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension
without significant proteinuria, or O14.-, Pre-eclampsia, for transient
hypertension of pregnancy.
8) Hypertension, Controlled
This diagnostic statement usually refers to an existing state of
hypertension under control by therapy. Assign the appropriate code from
categories I10-I15, Hypertensive diseases.
9) Hypertension, Uncontrolled
Uncontrolled hypertension may refer to untreated hypertension or
hypertension not responding to current therapeutic regimen. In either
case, assign the appropriate code from categories I10-I15, Hypertensive
diseases.
10) Hypertensive Crisis
Assign a code from category I16, Hypertensive crisis, for documented
hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency or unspecified
hypertensive crisis. Code also any identified hypertensive disease (I10-
I15). The sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter.
11) Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension is classified to category I27, Other pulmonary
heart diseases. For secondary pulmonary hypertension (I27.1, I27.2-),
code also any associated conditions or adverse effects of drugs or toxins.
The sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter, except for
adverse effects of drugs (See Section I.C.19.e.).
12) Hypertension, Resistant
Resistant hypertension refers to blood pressure of a patient with
hypertension that remains above goal in spite of the use of
antihypertensive medications. Assign code I1A.0, Resistant
hypertension, as an additional code when apparent treatment resistant
hypertension, treatment resistant hypertension, or true resistant
hypertension is documented by the provider. A code for the specific type
of existing hypertension is sequenced first, if known.
b. Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease and Angina
ICD-10-CM has combination codes for atherosclerotic heart disease with angina
pectoris. The subcategories for these codes are I25.11, Atherosclerotic heart
disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris and I25.7, Atherosclerosis
of coronary artery bypass graft(s) and coronary artery of transplanted heart with
angina pectoris.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 52 of 121

When using one of these combination codes it is not necessary to use an
additional code for angina pectoris. A causal relationship can be assumed in a
patient with both atherosclerosis and angina pectoris, unless the documentation
indicates the angina is due to something other than the atherosclerosis.
If a patient with coronary artery disease is admitted due to an acute myocardial
infarction (AMI), the AMI should be sequenced before the coronary artery
disease.
See Section I.C.9. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
c. Intraoperative and Postprocedural Cerebrovascular Accident
Medical record documentation should clearly specify the cause- and-effect
relationship between the medical intervention and the cerebrovascular accident
in order to assign a code for intraoperative or postprocedural cerebrovascular
accident.
Proper code assignment depends on whether it was an infarction or hemorrhage
and whether it occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively. If it was a cerebral
hemorrhage, code assignment depends on the type of procedure performed.
d. Sequelae of Cerebrovascular Disease
1) Category I69, Sequelae of Cerebrovascular disease
Category I69 is used to indicate conditions classifiable to categories I60-
I67 as the causes of sequela (neurologic deficits), themselves classified
elsewhere. These “late effects” include neurologic deficits that persist
after initial onset of conditions classifiable to categories I60-I67. The
neurologic deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease may be present
from the onset or may arise at any time after the onset of the condition
classifiable to categories I60-I67.
Codes from category I69, Sequelae of cerebrovascular disease, that
specify hemiplegia, hemiparesis and monoplegia identify whether the
dominant or nondominant side is affected. Should the affected side be
documented, but not specified as dominant or nondominant, and the
classification system does not indicate a default, code selection is as
follows:
• For ambidextrous patients, the default should be dominant.
• If the left side is affected, the default is non-dominant.
• If the right side is affected, the default is dominant.
2) Codes from category I69 with codes from I60-I67
Codes from category I69 may be assigned on a health care record with
codes from I60-I67, if the patient has a current cerebrovascular disease
and deficits from an old cerebrovascular disease.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 53 of 121

3) Codes from category I69 and Personal history of transient
ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction (Z86.73)
Codes from category I69 should not be assigned if the patient does not
have neurologic deficits.
See Section I.C.21.4. History (of) for use of personal history codes
e. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
1) Type 1 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-
ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
The ICD-10-CM codes for type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
identify the site, such as anterolateral wall or true posterior wall.
Subcategories I21.0-I21.2 and code I21.3 are used for type 1 ST
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Code I21.4, Non-ST elevation
(NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, is used for type 1 non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and nontransmural MIs.
If a type 1 NSTEMI evolves to STEMI, assign the STEMI code. If a type
1 STEMI converts to NSTEMI due to thrombolytic therapy, it is still
coded as STEMI.
For encounters occurring while the myocardial infarction is equal to, or
less than, four weeks old, including transfers to another acute setting or a
postacute setting, and the myocardial infarction meets the definition for
“other diagnoses” (see Section III, Reporting Additional Diagnoses),
codes from category I21 may continue to be reported. For encounters
after the 4-week time frame and the patient is still receiving care related
to the myocardial infarction, the appropriate aftercare code should be
assigned, rather than a code from category I21. For old or healed
myocardial infarctions not requiring further care, code I25.2, Old
myocardial infarction, may be assigned.
2) Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified
Code I21.9, Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified, is the default for
unspecified acute myocardial infarction or unspecified type. If only type
1 STEMI or transmural MI without the site is documented, assign code
I21.3, ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of unspecified site.
3) AMI documented as nontransmural or subendocardial but site
provided
If an AMI is documented as nontransmural or subendocardial, but the
site is provided, it is still coded as a subendocardial AMI.
See Section I.C.21.3. for information on coding status post
administration of tPA in a different facility within the last 24 hours.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 54 of 121

4) Subsequent acute myocardial infarction
A code from category I22, Subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) and non-
ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, is to be used when a
patient who has suffered a type 1 or unspecified AMI has a new AMI
within the 4 week time frame of the initial AMI. A code from category
I22 must be used in conjunction with a code from category I21. The
sequencing of the I22 and I21 codes depends on the circumstances of the
encounter.
Do not assign code I22 for subsequent myocardial infarctions other than
type 1 or unspecified. For subsequent type 2 AMI assign only code
I21.A1. For subsequent type 4 or type 5 AMI, assign only code I21.A9.
If a subsequent myocardial infarction of one type occurs within 4 weeks
of a myocardial infarction of a different type, assign the appropriate
codes from category I21 to identify each type. Do not assign a code from
I22. Codes from category I22 should only be assigned if both the initial
and subsequent myocardial infarctions are type 1 or unspecified.
5) Other Types of Myocardial Infarction
The ICD-10-CM provides codes for different types of myocardial
infarction. Type 1 myocardial infarctions are assigned to codes I21.0-
I21.4.
Type 2 myocardial infarction (myocardial infarction due to demand
ischemia or secondary to ischemic imbalance) is assigned to code
I21.A1, Myocardial infarction type 2 with the underlying cause coded
first, if applicable. Do not assign code I24.89, Other forms of acute
ischemic heart disease, for the demand ischemia. If a type 2 AMI is
described as NSTEMI or STEMI, only assign code I21.A1. Codes
I21.01-I21.4 should only be assigned for type 1 AMIs.
Acute myocardial infarctions type 3, 4a, 4b, 4c and 5 are assigned to
code I21.A9, Other myocardial infarction type.
The "Code also" and "Code first" notes should be followed related to
complications, and for coding of postprocedural myocardial infarctions
during or following cardiac surgery.
6) Myocardial Infarction with Coronary Microvascular
Dysfunction
Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is a condition that impacts
the microvasculature by restricting microvascular flow and increasing
microvascular resistance. Code I21.B, Myocardial infarction with
coronary microvascular dysfunction, is assigned for myocardial
infarction with coronary microvascular disease, myocardial infarction
with coronary microvascular dysfunction, and myocardial infarction with
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 55 of 121

non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) with microvascular
disease.
10. Chapter 10: Diseases of the Respiratory System (J00-J99), U07.0
a. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD] and Asthma
1) Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchitis and
asthma
The codes in categories J44 and J45 distinguish between uncomplicated
cases and those in acute exacerbation. An acute exacerbation is a
worsening or a decompensation of a chronic condition. An acute
exacerbation is not equivalent to an infection superimposed on a chronic
condition, though an exacerbation may be triggered by an infection.
b. Acute Respiratory Failure
1) Acute respiratory failure as principal diagnosis
A code from subcategory J96.0, Acute respiratory failure, or subcategory
J96.2, Acute and chronic respiratory failure, may be assigned as a
principal diagnosis when it is the condition established after study to be
chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission to the hospital, and the
selection is supported by the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List.
However, chapter- specific coding guidelines (such as obstetrics,
poisoning, HIV, newborn) that provide sequencing direction take
precedence.
2) Acute respiratory failure as secondary diagnosis
Respiratory failure may be listed as a secondary diagnosis if it occurs
after admission, or if it is present on admission, but does not meet the
definition of principal diagnosis.
3) Sequencing of acute respiratory failure and another acute
condition
When a patient is admitted with respiratory failure and another acute
condition, (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,
aspiration pneumonia), the principal diagnosis will not be the same in
every situation. This applies whether the other acute condition is a
respiratory or nonrespiratory condition. Selection of the principal
diagnosis will be dependent on the circumstances of admission. If both
the respiratory failure and the other acute condition are equally
responsible for occasioning the admission to the hospital, and there are
no chapter-specific sequencing rules, the guideline regarding two or
more diagnoses that equally meet the definition for principal diagnosis
(Section II, C.) may be applied in these situations.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 56 of 121

If the documentation is not clear as to whether acute respiratory failure
and another condition are equally responsible for occasioning the
admission, query the provider for clarification.
c. Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses
Code only confirmed cases of influenza due to certain identified influenza
viruses (category J09), and due to other identified influenza virus (category J10).
This is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H. (Uncertain
Diagnosis).
In this context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of positive
laboratory testing specific for avian or other novel influenza A or other
identified influenza virus. However, coding should be based on the provider’s
diagnostic statement that the patient has avian influenza, or other novel
influenza A, for category J09, or has another particular identified strain of
influenza, such as H1N1 or H3N2, but not identified as novel or variant, for
category J10.
If the provider records “suspected” or “possible” or “probable” avian influenza,
or novel influenza, or other identified influenza, then the appropriate influenza
code from category J11, Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus, should be
assigned. A code from category J09, Influenza due to certain identified influenza
viruses, should not be assigned nor should a code from category J10, Influenza
due to other identified influenza virus.
d. Ventilator associated Pneumonia
1) Documentation of Ventilator associated Pneumonia
As with all procedural or postprocedural complications, code assignment
is based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship between the
condition and the procedure.
Code J95.851, Ventilator associated pneumonia, should be assigned only
when the provider has documented ventilator associated pneumonia
(VAP). An additional code to identify the organism (e.g., Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, code B96.5) should also be assigned. Do not assign an
additional code from categories J12-J18 to identify the type of
pneumonia.
Code J95.851 should not be assigned for cases where the patient has
pneumonia and is on a mechanical ventilator and the provider has not
specifically stated that the pneumonia is ventilator-associated
pneumonia. If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has
a pneumonia that is a complication attributable to the mechanical
ventilator, query the provider.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 57 of 121

2) Ventilator associated Pneumonia Develops after Admission
A patient may be admitted with one type of pneumonia (e.g., code J13,
Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumonia) and subsequently develop
VAP. In this instance, the principal diagnosis would be the appropriate
code from categories J12-J18 for the pneumonia diagnosed at the time of
admission. Code J95.851, Ventilator associated pneumonia, would be
assigned as an additional diagnosis when the provider has also
documented the presence of ventilator associated pneumonia.
e. Vaping-related disorders
For patients presenting with condition(s) related to vaping, assign code U07.0,
Vaping-related disorder, as the principal diagnosis. For lung injury due to
vaping, assign only code U07.0. Assign additional codes for other
manifestations, such as acute respiratory failure (subcategory J96.0-) or
pneumonitis (code J68.0).
Associated respiratory signs and symptoms due to vaping, such as cough,
shortness of breath, etc., are not coded separately, when a definitive diagnosis
has been established. However, it would be appropriate to code separately any
gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
See Section I.C.1.g.1.c.i. for Pneumonia confirmed as due to COVID-19
11. Chapter 11: Diseases of the Digestive System (K00-K95)
Reserved for future guideline expansion
12. Chapter 12: Diseases of the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue
(L00-L99)
a. Pressure ulcer stage codes
1) Pressure ulcer stages
Codes in category L89, Pressure ulcer, identify the site and stage of the
pressure ulcer.
The ICD-10-CM classifies pressure ulcer stages based on severity, which
is designated by stages 1-4, deep tissue pressure injury, unspecified
stage, and unstageable.
Assign as many codes from category L89 as needed to identify all the
pressure ulcers the patient has, if applicable.
See Section I.B.14. for pressure ulcer stage documentation by clinicians
other than patient's provider.
2) Unstageable pressure ulcers
Assignment of the code for unstageable pressure ulcer (L89.--0) should
be based on the clinical documentation. These codes are used for
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 58 of 121

pressure ulcers whose stage cannot be clinically determined (e.g., the
ulcer is covered by eschar or has been treated with a skin or muscle
graft). This code should not be confused with the codes for unspecified
stage (L89.--9). When there is no documentation regarding the stage of
the pressure ulcer, assign the appropriate code for unspecified stage
(L89.-- 9).
If during an encounter, the stage of an unstageable pressure ulcer is
revealed after debridement, assign only the code for the stage revealed
following debridement.
3) Documented pressure ulcer stage
Assignment of the pressure ulcer stage code should be guided by clinical
documentation of the stage or documentation of the terms found in the
Alphabetic Index. For clinical terms describing the stage that are not
found in the Alphabetic Index, and there is no documentation of the
stage, the provider should be queried.
4) Patients admitted with pressure ulcers documented as healed
No code is assigned if the documentation states that the pressure ulcer is
completely healed at the time of admission.
5) Pressure ulcers documented as healing
Pressure ulcers described as healing should be assigned the appropriate
pressure ulcer stage code based on the documentation in the medical
record. If the documentation does not provide information about the
stage of the healing pressure ulcer, assign the appropriate code for
unspecified stage.
If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a current
(new) pressure ulcer or if the patient is being treated for a healing
pressure ulcer, query the provider.
For ulcers that were present on admission but healed at the time of
discharge, assign the code for the site and stage of the pressure ulcer at
the time of admission.
6) Patient admitted with pressure ulcer evolving into another
stage during the admission
If a patient is admitted to an inpatient hospital with a pressure ulcer at
one stage and it progresses to a higher stage, two separate codes should
be assigned: one code for the site and stage of the ulcer on admission and
a second code for the same ulcer site and the highest stage reported
during the stay.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 59 of 121

7) Pressure-induced deep tissue damage
For pressure-induced deep tissue damage or deep tissue pressure injury,
assign only the appropriate code for pressure-induced deep tissue
damage (L89.--6).
b. Non-Pressure Chronic Ulcers
1) Patients admitted with non-pressure ulcers documented as
healed
No code is assigned if the documentation states that the non-pressure
ulcer is completely healed at the time of admission.
2) Non-pressure ulcers documented as healing
Non-pressure ulcers described as healing should be assigned the
appropriate non-pressure ulcer code based on the documentation in the
medical record. If the documentation does not provide information about
the severity of the healing non-pressure ulcer, assign the appropriate
code for unspecified severity.
If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a current
(new) non-pressure ulcer or if the patient is being treated for a healing
non-pressure ulcer, query the provider.
For ulcers that were present on admission but healed at the time of
discharge, assign the code for the site and severity of the non-pressure
ulcer at the time of admission.
3) Patient admitted with non-pressure ulcer that progresses to
another severity level during the admission
If a patient is admitted to an inpatient hospital with a non-pressure ulcer
at one severity level and it progresses to a higher severity level, two
separate codes should be assigned: one code for the site and severity
level of the ulcer on admission and a second code for the same ulcer site
and the highest severity level reported during the stay.
See Section I.B.14. for pressure ulcer stage documentation by clinicians
other than patient's provider
13. Chapter 13: Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective
Tissue (M00-M99)
a. Site and laterality
Most of the codes within Chapter 13 have site and laterality designations. The
site represents the bone, joint or the muscle involved.
1) Bone versus joint
For certain conditions, the bone may be affected at the upper or lower
end, (e.g., avascular necrosis of bone, M87, Osteoporosis, M80, M81).
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 60 of 121

Though the portion of the bone affected may be at the joint, the site
designation will be the bone, not the joint.
2) Multiple sites
Codes describing specified sites are assigned individually by site
when documented. When the specified site(s) are not documented,
assign the appropriate code for “multiple sites.”
b. Acute traumatic versus chronic or recurrent musculoskeletal
conditions
Many musculoskeletal conditions are a result of previous injury or trauma to a
site, or are recurrent conditions. Bone, joint or muscle conditions that are the
result of a healed injury are usually found in chapter 13. Recurrent bone, joint or
muscle conditions are also usually found in chapter 13. Any current, acute injury
should be coded to the appropriate injury code from chapter 19. Chronic or
recurrent conditions should generally be coded with a code from chapter 13. If it
is difficult to determine from the documentation in the record which code is best
to describe a condition, query the provider.
c. Coding of Pathologic Fractures
7th character A is for use as long as the patient is receiving active treatment for
the fracture. While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over
the course of treatment for a pathological fracture, assignment of the 7th
character is based on whether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not
whether the provider is seeing the patient for the first time.
7th character D is to be used for encounters after the patient has completed
active treatment for the fracture and is receiving routine care for the fracture
during the healing or recovery phase. The other 7th characters, listed under each
subcategory in the Tabular List, are to be used for subsequent encounters for
treatment of problems associated with the healing, such as malunions,
nonunions, and sequelae.
Care for complications of surgical treatment for fracture repairs during the
healing or recovery phase should be coded with the appropriate complication
codes.
See Section I.C.19. Coding of traumatic fractures.
d. Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a systemic condition, meaning that all bones of the
musculoskeletal system are affected. Therefore, site is not a component of the
codes under category M81, Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture.
The site codes under category M80, Osteoporosis with current pathological
fracture, identify the site of the fracture, not the osteoporosis.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 61 of 121

1) Osteoporosis without pathological fracture
Category M81, Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture, is for
use for patients with osteoporosis who do not currently have a pathologic
fracture due to the osteoporosis, even if they have had a fracture in the
past. For patients with a history of osteoporosis fractures, status code
Z87.310, Personal history of (healed) osteoporosis fracture, should
follow the code from M81.
2) Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture
Category M80, Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, is for
patients who have a current pathologic fracture at the time of an
encounter. The codes under M80 identify the site of the fracture. A code
from category M80, not a traumatic fracture code, should be used for any
patient with known osteoporosis who suffers a fracture, even if the
patient had a minor fall or trauma, if that fall or trauma would not usually
break a normal, healthy bone.
e. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
See Section I.C.1.g.1.l. for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
14. Chapter 14: Diseases of Genitourinary System (N00-N99)
a. Chronic kidney disease
1) Stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
The ICD-10-CM classifies CKD based on severity. The severity of CKD
is designated by stages 1-5. Stage 2, code N18.2, equates to mild CKD;
stage 3, codes N18.30-N18.32, equate to moderate CKD; and stage 4,
code N18.4, equates to severe CKD. Code N18.6, End stage renal
disease (ESRD), is assigned when the provider has documented end-
stage renal disease (ESRD).
If both a stage of CKD and ESRD are documented, assign code N18.6
only.
2) Chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant status
Patients who have undergone kidney transplant may still have some form
of chronic kidney disease (CKD) because the kidney transplant may not
fully restore kidney function. Therefore, the presence of CKD alone does
not constitute a transplant complication. Assign the appropriate N18
code for the patient’s stage of CKD and code Z94.0, Kidney transplant
status. If a transplant complication such as failure or rejection or other
transplant complication is documented, see section I.C.19.g for
information on coding complications of a kidney transplant. If the
documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a complication of
the transplant, query the provider.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 62 of 121

3) Chronic kidney disease with other conditions
Patients with CKD may also suffer from other serious conditions, most
commonly diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The sequencing of the
CKD code in relationship to codes for other contributing conditions is
based on the conventions in the Tabular List.
See I.C.9. Hypertensive chronic kidney disease.
See I.C.19. Chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant complications.
15. Chapter 15: Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium
(O00-O9A)
a. General Rules for Obstetric Cases
1) Codes from chapter 15 and sequencing priority
Obstetric cases require codes from chapter 15, codes in the range O00-
O9A, Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium. Chapter 15 codes have
sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes
from other chapters may be used in conjunction with chapter 15 codes to
further specify conditions. Should the provider document that the
pregnancy is incidental to the encounter, then code Z33.1, Pregnant state,
incidental, should be used in place of any chapter 15 codes. It is the
provider’s responsibility to state that the condition being treated is not
affecting the pregnancy.
2) Chapter 15 codes used only on the maternal record
Chapter 15 codes are to be used only on the maternal record, never on
the record of the newborn.
3) Final character for trimester
The majority of codes in Chapter 15 have a final character indicating the
trimester of pregnancy. The timeframes for the trimesters are indicated at
the beginning of the chapter. If trimester is not a component of a code, it
is because the condition always occurs in a specific trimester, or the
concept of trimester of pregnancy is not applicable. Certain codes have
characters for only certain trimesters because the condition does not
occur in all trimesters, but it may occur in more than just one.
Assignment of the final character for trimester should be based on the
provider’s documentation of the trimester (or number of weeks) for the
current admission/encounter. This applies to the assignment of trimester
for pre-existing conditions as well as those that develop during or are due
to the pregnancy. The provider’s documentation of the number of weeks
may be used to assign the appropriate code identifying the trimester.
Whenever delivery occurs during the current admission, and there is an
“in childbirth” option for the obstetric complication being coded, the “in
childbirth” code should be assigned. When the classification does not
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 63 of 121

provide an obstetric code with an “in childbirth” option, it is appropriate
to assign a code describing the current trimester.
4) Selection of trimester for inpatient admissions that encompass
more than one trimester
In instances when a patient is admitted to a hospital for complications of
pregnancy during one trimester and remains in the hospital into a
subsequent trimester, the trimester character for the antepartum
complication code should be assigned on the basis of the trimester when
the complication developed, not the trimester of the discharge. If the
condition developed prior to the current admission/encounter or
represents a pre-existing condition, the trimester character for the
trimester at the time of the admission/encounter should be assigned.
5) Unspecified trimester
Each category that includes codes for trimester has a code for
“unspecified trimester.” The “unspecified trimester” code should rarely
be used, such as when the documentation in the record is insufficient to
determine the trimester and it is not possible to obtain clarification.
6) 7th character for fetus identification
Where applicable, a 7th character is to be assigned for certain categories
(O31, O32, O33.3 - O33.6, O35, O36, O40, O41, O60.1, O60.2, O64,
and O69) to identify the fetus for which the complication code applies.
Assign 7th character “0”:
• For single gestations
• When the documentation in the record is insufficient to determine
the fetus affected and it is not possible to obtain clarification.
• When it is not possible to clinically determine which fetus is
affected.
7) Completed weeks of gestation
In ICD-10-CM, “completed” weeks of gestation refers to full weeks. For
example, if the provider documents gestation at 39 weeks and 6 days, the
code for 39 weeks of gestation should be assigned, as the patient has not
yet reached 40 completed weeks.
b. Selection of OB Principal or First-listed Diagnosis
1) Routine outpatient prenatal visits
For routine outpatient prenatal visits when no complications are present,
a code from category Z34, Encounter for supervision of normal
pregnancy, should be used as the first-listed diagnosis. These codes
should not be used in conjunction with chapter 15 codes.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 64 of 121

2) Supervision of High-Risk Pregnancy
Codes from category O09, Supervision of high-risk pregnancy, are
intended for use only during the prenatal period. For complications
during the labor or delivery episode as a result of a high-risk pregnancy,
assign the applicable complication codes from Chapter 15. If there are no
complications during the labor or delivery episode, assign code O80,
Encounter for full-term uncomplicated delivery.
For routine prenatal outpatient visits for patients with high-risk
pregnancies, a code from category O09, Supervision of high-risk
pregnancy, should be used as the first-listed diagnosis. Secondary
chapter 15 codes may be used in conjunction with these codes if
appropriate.
3) Episodes when no delivery occurs
In episodes when no delivery occurs, the principal diagnosis should
correspond to the principal complication of the pregnancy which
necessitated the encounter. Should more than one complication exist, all
of which are treated or monitored, any of the complication codes may be
sequenced first.
4) When a delivery occurs
When an obstetric patient is admitted and delivers during that admission,
the condition that prompted the admission should be sequenced as the
principal diagnosis. If multiple conditions prompted the admission,
sequence the one most related to the delivery as the principal diagnosis.
A code for any complication of the delivery should be assigned as an
additional diagnosis. In cases of cesarean delivery, if the patient was
admitted with a condition that resulted in the performance of a cesarean
procedure, that condition should be selected as the principal diagnosis. If
the reason for the admission was unrelated to the condition resulting in
the cesarean delivery, the condition related to the reason for the
admission should be selected as the principal diagnosis.
5) Outcome of delivery
A code from category Z37, Outcome of delivery, should be included on
every maternal record when a delivery has occurred. These codes are not
to be used on subsequent records or on the newborn record.
c. Pre-existing conditions versus conditions due to the pregnancy
Certain categories in Chapter 15 distinguish between conditions of the mother
that existed prior to pregnancy (pre-existing) and those that are a direct result of
pregnancy. When assigning codes from Chapter 15, it is important to assess if a
condition was pre-existing prior to pregnancy or developed during or due to the
pregnancy in order to assign the correct code.
Categories that do not distinguish between pre-existing and pregnancy-related
conditions may be used for either. It is acceptable to use codes specifically for
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 65 of 121

the puerperium with codes complicating pregnancy and childbirth if a condition
arises postpartum during the delivery encounter.
d. Pre-existing hypertension in pregnancy
Category O10, Pre-existing hypertension complicating pregnancy, childbirth and
the puerperium, includes codes for hypertensive heart and hypertensive chronic
kidney disease. When assigning one of the O10 codes that includes hypertensive
heart disease or hypertensive chronic kidney disease, it is necessary to add a
secondary code from the appropriate hypertension category to specify the type
of heart failure or chronic kidney disease.
See Section I.C.9. Hypertension.
e. Fetal Conditions Affecting the Management of the Mother
1) Codes from categories O35 and O36
Codes from categories O35, Maternal care for known or suspected fetal
abnormality and damage, and O36, Maternal care for other fetal
problems, are assigned only when the fetal condition is actually
responsible for modifying the management of the mother, i.e., by
requiring diagnostic studies, additional observation, special care, or
termination of pregnancy. The fact that the fetal condition exists does not
justify assigning a code from this series to the mother’s record.
2) In utero surgery
In cases when surgery is performed on the fetus, a diagnosis code from
category O35, Maternal care for known or suspected fetal abnormality
and damage, should be assigned identifying the fetal condition. Assign
the appropriate procedure code for the procedure performed.
No code from Chapter 16, the perinatal codes, should be used on the
mother’s record to identify fetal conditions. Surgery performed in utero
on a fetus is still to be coded as an obstetric encounter.
f. HIV Infection in Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium
During pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, a patient admitted because of an
HIV-related illness should receive a principal diagnosis from subcategory
O98.7-, Human immunodeficiency [HIV] disease complicating pregnancy,
childbirth and the puerperium, followed by the code(s) for the HIV-related
illness(es).
Patients with asymptomatic HIV infection status admitted during pregnancy,
childbirth, or the puerperium should receive codes of O98.7- and Z21,
Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status.
g. Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy
Diabetes mellitus is a significant complicating factor in pregnancy. Pregnant
patients who are diabetic should be assigned a code from category O24,
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 66 of 121

Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, first, followed
by the appropriate diabetes code(s) (E08-E13) from Chapter 4.
h. Long term use of insulin and oral hypoglycemics
See section I.C.4.a.3 for information on the long-term use of insulin and oral
hypoglycemics.
i. Gestational (pregnancy induced) diabetes
Gestational (pregnancy induced) diabetes can occur during the second and third
trimester of pregnancy in patients who were not diabetic prior to pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes can cause complications in the pregnancy similar to those
of pre-existing diabetes mellitus. It also puts the patient at greater risk of
developing diabetes after the pregnancy.
Codes for gestational diabetes are in subcategory O24.4, Gestational diabetes
mellitus. No other code from category O24, Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium, should be used with a code from O24.4.
The codes under subcategory O24.4 include diet controlled, insulin controlled,
and controlled by oral hypoglycemic drugs. If a patient with gestational diabetes
is treated with both diet and insulin, only the code for insulin-controlled is
required. If a patient with gestational diabetes is treated with both diet and oral
hypoglycemic medications, only the code for "controlled by oral hypoglycemic
drugs" is required. Codes Z79.4, Long-term (current) use of insulin, Z79.84,
Long-term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, and Z79.85, Long-term
(current) use of injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, should not be assigned
with codes from subcategory O24.4.
An abnormal glucose tolerance in pregnancy is assigned a code from
subcategory O99.81, Abnormal glucose complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and
the puerperium.
j. Sepsis and septic shock complicating abortion, pregnancy,
childbirth and the puerperium
When assigning a chapter 15 code for sepsis complicating abortion, pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium, a code for the specific type of infection should
be assigned as an additional diagnosis. If severe sepsis is present, a code from
subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis, and code(s) for associated organ
dysfunction(s) should also be assigned as additional diagnoses.
k. Puerperal sepsis
Code O85, Puerperal sepsis, should be assigned with a secondary code to
identify the causal organism (e.g., for a bacterial infection, assign a code from
category B95-B96, Bacterial infections in conditions classified elsewhere). A
code from category A40, Streptococcal sepsis, or A41, Other sepsis, should not
be used for puerperal sepsis. If applicable, use additional codes to identify
severe sepsis (R65.2-) and any associated acute organ dysfunction.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 67 of 121

Code O85 should not be assigned for sepsis following an obstetrical procedure
(See Section I.C.1.d.5.b., Sepsis due to a postprocedural infection).
l. Alcohol, tobacco and drug use during pregnancy, childbirth and
the puerperium
1) Alcohol use during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
Codes under subcategory O99.31, Alcohol use complicating pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium, should be assigned for any pregnancy
case when a patient uses alcohol during the pregnancy or postpartum. A
secondary code from category F10, Alcohol related disorders, should
also be assigned to identify manifestations of the alcohol use.
2) Tobacco use during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
Codes under subcategory O99.33, Smoking (tobacco) complicating
pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, should be assigned for any
pregnancy case when a patient uses any type of tobacco product during
the pregnancy or postpartum.
A secondary code from category F17, Nicotine dependence, should also
be assigned to identify the type of nicotine dependence.
3) Drug use during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
Codes under subcategory O99.32, Drug use complicating pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium, should be assigned for any pregnancy
case when a patient uses drugs during the pregnancy or postpartum. This
can involve illegal drugs, or inappropriate use or abuse of prescription
drugs. Secondary code(s) from categories F11-F16 and F18-F19 should
also be assigned to identify manifestations of the drug use.
m. Poisoning, toxic effects, adverse effects and underdosing in a
pregnant patient
A code from subcategory O9A.2, Injury, poisoning and certain other
consequences of external causes complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the
puerperium, should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury,
poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing code, and then the
additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic
effect, adverse effect or underdosing.
See Section I.C.19. Adverse effects, poisoning, underdosing and toxic effects.
n. Normal Delivery, Code O80
1) Encounter for full term uncomplicated delivery
Code O80 should be assigned when a patient is admitted for a full-term
normal delivery and delivers a single, healthy infant without any
complications antepartum, during the delivery, or postpartum during the
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 68 of 121

delivery episode. Code O80 is always a principal diagnosis. It is not to be
used if any other code from chapter 15 is needed to describe a current
complication of the antenatal, delivery, or postnatal period. Additional
codes from other chapters may be used with code O80 if they are not
related to or are in any way complicating the pregnancy.
2) Uncomplicated delivery with resolved antepartum complication
Code O80 may be used if the patient had a complication at some point
during the pregnancy, but the complication is not present at the time of
the admission for delivery.
3) Outcome of delivery for O80
Z37.0, Single live birth, is the only outcome of delivery code appropriate
for use with O80.
o. The Peripartum and Postpartum Periods
1) Peripartum and Postpartum periods
The postpartum period begins immediately after delivery and continues
for six weeks following delivery. The peripartum period is defined as the
last month of pregnancy to five months postpartum.
2) Peripartum and postpartum complication
A postpartum complication is any complication occurring within the six-
week period.
3) Pregnancy-related complications after 6-week period
Chapter 15 codes may also be used to describe pregnancy-related
complications after the peripartum or postpartum period if the provider
documents that a condition is pregnancy related.
4) Admission for routine postpartum care following delivery
outside hospital
When the mother delivers outside the hospital prior to admission and is
admitted for routine postpartum care and no complications are noted,
code Z39.0, Encounter for care and examination of mother immediately
after delivery, should be assigned as the principal diagnosis.
5) Pregnancy associated cardiomyopathy
Pregnancy associated cardiomyopathy, code O90.3, is unique in that it
may be diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy but may continue to
progress months after delivery. For this reason, it is referred to as
peripartum cardiomyopathy. Code O90.3 is only for use when the
cardiomyopathy develops as a result of pregnancy in a patient who did
not have pre-existing heart disease.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 69 of 121

p. Code O94, Sequelae of complication of pregnancy, childbirth, and
the puerperium
1) Code O94
Code O94, Sequelae of complication of pregnancy, childbirth, and the
puerperium, is for use in those cases when an initial complication of a
pregnancy develops a sequela or sequelae requiring care or treatment at a
future date.
2) After the initial postpartum period
This code may be used at any time after the initial postpartum period.
3) Sequencing of Code O94
This code, like all sequela codes, is to be sequenced following the code
describing the sequelae of the complication.
q. Termination of Pregnancy and Spontaneous abortions
1) Abortion with Liveborn Fetus
When an attempted termination of pregnancy results in a liveborn fetus,
assign code Z33.2, Encounter for elective termination of pregnancy and a
code from category Z37, Outcome of Delivery.
2) Retained Products of Conception following an abortion
Subsequent encounters for retained products of conception following a
spontaneous abortion or elective termination of pregnancy, without
complications are assigned O03.4, Incomplete spontaneous abortion
without complication, or code O07.4, Failed attempted termination of
pregnancy without complication. This advice is appropriate even when
the patient was discharged previously with a discharge diagnosis of
complete abortion. If the patient has a specific complication associated
with the spontaneous abortion or elective termination of pregnancy in
addition to retained products of conception, assign the appropriate
complication code (e.g., O03.-, O04.-, O07.-) instead of code O03.4 or
O07.4.
3) Complications leading to abortion
Codes from Chapter 15 may be used as additional codes to identify any
documented complications of the pregnancy in conjunction with codes in
categories in O04, O07 and O08.
4) Hemorrhage following elective abortion
For hemorrhage post elective abortion, assign code O04.6, Delayed or
excessive hemorrhage following (induced) termination of pregnancy. Do
not assign code O72.1, Other immediate postpartum hemorrhage, as this
code should not be assigned for post abortion conditions.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 70 of 121

r. Abuse in a pregnant patient
For suspected or confirmed cases of abuse of a pregnant patient, a code(s) from
subcategories O9A.3, Physical abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and
the puerperium, O9A.4, Sexual abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and
the puerperium, and O9A.5, Psychological abuse complicating pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium, should be sequenced first, followed by the
appropriate codes (if applicable) to identify any associated current injury due to
physical abuse, sexual abuse, and the perpetrator of abuse.
See Section I.C.19. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment.
s. COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, childbirth, and the
puerperium
During pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, when COVID-19 is the reason
for admission/encounter, code O98.5-, Other viral diseases complicating
pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, should be sequenced as the
principal/first-listed diagnosis, and code U07.1, COVID-19, and the appropriate
codes for associated manifestation(s) should be assigned as additional diagnoses.
Codes from Chapter 15 always take sequencing priority.
If the reason for admission/encounter is unrelated to COVID-19 but the patient
has been diagnosed with COVID-19 during the admission/encounter, the
appropriate code for the reason for admission/encounter should be sequenced as
the principal/first-listed diagnosis, and codes O98.5- and U07.1, as well as the
appropriate codes for associated COVID-19 manifestations, should be assigned
as additional diagnoses.
16. Chapter 16: Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period
(P00-P96)
For coding and reporting purposes the perinatal period is defined as before birth through
the 28th day following birth. The following guidelines are provided for reporting
purposes.
a. General Perinatal Rules
1) Use of Chapter 16 Codes
Codes in this chapter are never for use on the maternal record. Codes
from Chapter 15, the obstetric chapter, are never permitted on the
newborn record. Chapter 16 codes may be used throughout the life of the
patient if the condition is still present.
2) Principal Diagnosis for Birth Record
When coding the birth episode in a newborn record, assign a code from
category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of
delivery, as the principal diagnosis. A code from category Z38 is
assigned only once, to a newborn at the time of birth. If a newborn is
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 71 of 121

transferred to another institution, a code from category Z38 should not be
used at the receiving hospital.
A code from category Z38 is used only on the newborn record, not on the
mother’s record.
3) Use of Codes from other Chapters with Codes from Chapter 16
Codes from other chapters may be used with codes from chapter 16 if the
codes from the other chapters provide more specific detail. Codes for
signs and symptoms may be assigned when a definitive diagnosis has not
been established. If the reason for the encounter is a perinatal condition,
the code from chapter 16 should be sequenced first.
4) Use of Chapter 16 Codes after the Perinatal Period
Should a condition originate in the perinatal period, and continue
throughout the life of the patient, the perinatal code should continue to be
used regardless of the patient’s age.
5) Birth process or community acquired conditions
If a newborn has a condition that may be either due to the birth process
or community acquired and the documentation does not indicate which it
is, the default is due to the birth process and the code from Chapter 16
should be used. If the condition is community-acquired, a code from
Chapter 16 should not be assigned.
For COVID-19 infection in a newborn, see guideline I.C.16.h.
6) Code all clinically significant conditions
All clinically significant conditions noted on routine newborn
examination should be coded. A condition is clinically significant if it
requires:
 clinical evaluation; or
 therapeutic treatment; or
 diagnostic procedures; or
 extended length of hospital stay; or
 increased nursing care and/or monitoring; or
 has implications for future health care needs
Note: The perinatal guidelines listed above are the same as the general
coding guidelines for “additional diagnoses,” except for the final point
regarding implications for future health care needs. Codes should be
assigned for conditions that have been specified by the provider as
having implications for future health care needs.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 72 of 121

b. Observation and Evaluation of Newborns for Suspected
Conditions not Found
1) Use of Z05 codes
Assign a code from category Z05, Observation and evaluation of
newborn for suspected diseases and conditions ruled out, to identify
those instances when a healthy newborn is evaluated for a suspected
condition/disease that is determined after study not to be present. Do not
use a code from category Z05 when the patient is documented to have
signs or symptoms of a suspected problem; in such cases code the sign or
symptom.
2) Z05 on other than the birth record
A code from category Z05 may also be assigned as a principal or first-
listed code for readmissions or encounters when the code from category
Z38 code no longer applies. Codes from category Z05 are for use only
for healthy newborns and infants for which no condition after study is
found to be present.
3) Z05 on a birth record
A code from category Z05 is to be used as a secondary code after the
code from category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and
type of delivery.
c. Coding Additional Perinatal Diagnoses
1) Assigning codes for conditions that require treatment
Assign codes for conditions that require treatment or further
investigation, prolong the length of stay, or require resource utilization.
2) Codes for conditions specified as having implications for future
health care needs
Assign codes for conditions that have been specified by the provider as
having implications for future health care needs.
Note: This guideline should not be used for adult patients.
d. Prematurity and Fetal Growth Retardation
Providers utilize different criteria in determining prematurity. A code for
prematurity should not be assigned unless it is documented. Assignment of
codes in categories P05, Disorders of newborn related to slow fetal growth and
fetal malnutrition, and P07, Disorders of newborn related to short gestation and
low birth weight, not elsewhere classified, should be based on the recorded birth
weight and estimated gestational age.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 73 of 121

When both birth weight and gestational age are available, two codes from
category P07 should be assigned, with the code for birth weight sequenced
before the code for gestational age.
e. Low birth weight and immaturity status
Codes from category P07, Disorders of newborn related to short gestation and
low birth weight, not elsewhere classified, are for use for a child or adult who
was premature or had a low birth weight as a newborn and this is affecting the
patient’s current health status.
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services, Status.
f. Bacterial Sepsis of Newborn
Category P36, Bacterial sepsis of newborn, includes congenital sepsis. If a
perinate is documented as having sepsis without documentation of congenital or
community acquired, the default is congenital and a code from category P36
should be assigned. If the P36 code includes the causal organism, an additional
code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as
the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other bacterial agents as the
cause of diseases classified elsewhere, should not be assigned. If the P36 code
does not include the causal organism, assign an additional code from category
B96. If applicable, use additional codes to identify severe sepsis (R65.2-) and
any associated acute organ dysfunction.
g. Stillbirth
Code P95, Stillbirth, is only for use in institutions that maintain separate records
for stillbirths. No other code should be used with P95. Code P95 should not be
used on the mother’s record.
h. COVID-19 Infection in Newborn
For a newborn that tests positive for COVID-19, assign code U07.1, COVID-19,
and the appropriate codes for associated manifestation(s) in neonates/newborns
in the absence of documentation indicating a specific type of transmission. For a
newborn that tests positive for COVID-19 and the provider documents the
condition was contracted in utero or during the birth process, assign codes
P35.8, Other congenital viral diseases, and U07.1, COVID-19. When coding the
birth episode in a newborn record, the appropriate code from category Z38,
Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of delivery, should be
assigned as the principal diagnosis.
17. Chapter 17: Congenital malformations, deformations, and
chromosomal abnormalities (Q00-QA1)
Assign an appropriate code(s) from categories Q00-QA1, Congenital malformations,
deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities when a malformation/deformation or
chromosomal abnormality is documented. A malformation/deformation/or
chromosomal abnormality may be the principal/first-listed diagnosis on a record or a
secondary diagnosis.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 74 of 121

When a malformation/deformation or chromosomal abnormality does not have a unique
code assignment, assign additional code(s) for any manifestations that may be present.
When the code assignment specifically identifies the malformation/deformation or
chromosomal abnormality, manifestations that are an inherent component of the
anomaly should not be coded separately. Additional codes should be assigned for
manifestations that are not an inherent component.
Codes from Chapter 17 may be used throughout the life of the patient. If a congenital
malformation or deformity has been corrected, a personal history code should be used to
identify the history of the malformation or deformity. Although present at birth, a
malformation/deformation/or chromosomal abnormality may not be identified until later
in life. Whenever the condition is diagnosed by the provider, it is appropriate to assign a
code from codes Q00-QA1. For the birth admission, the appropriate code from category
Z38, Liveborn infants, according to place of birth and type of delivery, should be
sequenced as the principal diagnosis, followed by any congenital anomaly codes, Q00-
QA1.
18. Chapter 18: Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory
findings, not elsewhere classified (R00-R99)
Chapter 18 includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other investigative
procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable
elsewhere is recorded. Signs and symptoms that point to a specific diagnosis have been
assigned to a category in other chapters of the classification.
a. Use of symptom codes
Codes that describe symptoms and signs are acceptable for reporting purposes
when a related definitive diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the
provider.
b. Use of a symptom code with a definitive diagnosis code
Codes for signs and symptoms may be reported in addition to a related definitive
diagnosis when the sign or symptom is not routinely associated with that
diagnosis, such as the various signs and symptoms associated with complex
syndromes. The definitive diagnosis code should be sequenced before the
symptom code.
Signs or symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process should
not be assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise instructed by the
classification.
c. Combination codes that include symptoms
ICD-10-CM contains a number of combination codes that identify both the
definitive diagnosis and common symptoms of that diagnosis. When using one
of these combination codes, an additional code should not be assigned for the
symptom.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 75 of 121

d. Repeated falls
Code R29.6, Repeated falls, is for use for encounters when a patient has recently
fallen and the reason for the fall is being investigated.
Code Z91.81, History of falling, is for use when a patient has fallen in the past
and is at risk for future falls. When appropriate, both codes R29.6 and Z91.81
may be assigned together.
e. Coma
Code R40.20, Unspecified coma, should be assigned when the underlying cause
of the coma is not known, or the cause is a traumatic brain injury and the coma
scale is not documented in the medical record.
Do not report codes for unspecified coma, individual or total Glasgow coma
scale scores for a patient with a medically induced coma or a sedated patient.
1) Coma Scale
The coma scale codes (R40.21- to R40.24-) can be used in conjunction
with traumatic brain injury codes. These codes cannot be used with code
R40.2A, Nontraumatic coma due to underlying condition. They are
primarily for use by trauma registries, but they may be used in any
setting where this information is collected. The coma scale codes should
be sequenced after the diagnosis code(s).
These codes, one from each subcategory, are needed to complete the
scale. The 7th character indicates when the scale was recorded. The 7th
character should match for all three codes.
At a minimum, report the initial score documented on presentation at
your facility. This may be a score from the emergency medicine
technician (EMT) or in the emergency department. If desired, a facility
may choose to capture multiple coma scale scores.
Assign code R40.24-, Glasgow coma scale, total score, when only the
total score is documented in the medical record and not the individual
score(s).
If multiple coma scores are captured within the first 24 hours after
hospital admission, assign only the code for the score at the time of
admission. ICD-10-CM does not classify coma scores that are reported
after admission but less than 24 hours later.
See Section I.B.14. for coma scale documentation by clinicians other
than patient's provider
f. Functional quadriplegia
GUIDELINE HAS BEEN DELETED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2017
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 76 of 121

g. SIRS due to Non-Infectious Process
The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can develop as a result of
certain non-infectious disease processes, such as trauma, malignant neoplasm, or
pancreatitis. When SIRS is documented with a noninfectious condition, and no
subsequent infection is documented, the code for the underlying condition, such
as an injury, should be assigned, followed by code R65.10, Systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin without acute
organ dysfunction, or code R65.11, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS) of non-infectious origin with acute organ dysfunction. If an associated
acute organ dysfunction is documented, the appropriate code(s) for the specific
type of organ dysfunction(s) should be assigned in addition to code R65.11. If
acute organ dysfunction is documented, but it cannot be determined if the acute
organ dysfunction is associated with SIRS or due to another condition (e.g.,
directly due to the trauma), the provider should be queried.
h. Death NOS
Code R99, Ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality, is only for use in the
very limited circumstance when a patient who has already died is brought into
an emergency department or other healthcare facility and is pronounced dead
upon arrival. It does not represent the discharge disposition of death.
i. NIHSS Stroke Scale
The NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) codes (R29.7- -) can be used in conjunction with
acute stroke codes (I60-I63) to identify the patient's neurological status and the
severity of the stroke. The stroke scale codes should be sequenced after the acute
stroke diagnosis code(s).
At a minimum, report the initial score documented. If desired, a facility may
choose to capture multiple stroke scale scores.
See Section I.B.14. for NIHSS stroke scale documentation by clinicians other
than patient's provider
19. Chapter 19: Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of
external causes (S00-T88)
a. Application of 7th Characters in Chapter 19
Most categories in chapter 19 have a 7th character requirement for each
applicable code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character values
(with the exception of fractures): A, initial encounter, D, subsequent encounter
and S, sequela. Categories for traumatic fractures have additional 7th character
values. While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the
course of treatment for an injury, assignment of the 7th character is based on
whether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider
is seeing the patient for the first time.
For complication codes, active treatment refers to treatment for the condition
described by the code, even though it may be related to an earlier precipitating
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 77 of 121

problem. For example, code T84.50XA, Infection and inflammatory reaction
due to unspecified internal joint prosthesis, initial encounter, is used when active
treatment is provided for the infection, even though the condition relates to the
prosthetic device, implant or graft that was placed at a previous encounter.
7th character “A”, initial encounter is used for each encounter where the patient
is receiving active treatment for the condition.
7th character “D” subsequent encounter is used for encounters after the patient
has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for
the condition during the healing or recovery phase.
The aftercare Z codes should not be used for aftercare for conditions such as
injuries or poisonings, where 7th characters are provided to identify subsequent
care. For example, for aftercare of an injury, assign the acute injury code with
the 7th character “D” (subsequent encounter).
7th character “S”, sequela, is for use for complications or conditions that arise as
a direct result of a condition, such as scar formation after a burn. The scars are
sequelae of the burn. When using 7th character “S”, it is necessary to use both
the injury code that precipitated the sequela and the code for the sequela itself.
The “S” is added only to the injury code, not the sequela code. The 7th character
“S” identifies the injury responsible for the sequela. The specific type of sequela
(e.g. scar) is sequenced first, followed by the injury code.
See Section I.B.10. Sequelae, (Late Effects)
b. Coding of Injuries
When coding injuries, assign separate codes for each injury unless a
combination code is provided, in which case the combination code is assigned.
Codes from category T07, Unspecified multiple injuries should not be assigned
in the inpatient setting unless information for a more specific code is not
available. Traumatic injury codes (S00- T14.9) are not to be used for normal,
healing surgical wounds or to identify complications of surgical wounds.
The code for the most serious injury, as determined by the provider and the
focus of treatment, is sequenced first.
1) Superficial injuries
Superficial injuries such as abrasions or contusions are not coded when
associated with more severe injuries of the same site.
2) Primary injury with damage to nerves/blood vessels
When a primary injury results in minor damage to peripheral nerves or
blood vessels, the primary injury is sequenced first with additional
code(s) for injuries to nerves and spinal cord (such as category S04),
and/or injury to blood vessels (such as category S15). When the primary
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 78 of 121

injury is to the blood vessels or nerves, that injury should be sequenced
first.
3) Iatrogenic injuries
Injury codes from Chapter 19 should not be assigned for injuries that
occur during, or as a result of, a medical intervention. Assign the
appropriate complication code(s).
c. Coding of Traumatic Fractures
The principles of multiple coding of injuries should be followed in coding
fractures. Fractures of specified sites are coded individually by site in
accordance with both the provisions within categories S02, S12, S22, S32, S42,
S49, S52, S59, S62, S72, S79, S82, S89, S92 and the level of detail furnished by
medical record content.
A fracture not indicated as open or closed should be coded to closed. A fracture
not indicated whether displaced or not displaced should be coded to displaced.
More specific guidelines are as follows:
1) Initial vs. subsequent encounter for fractures
Traumatic fractures are coded using the appropriate 7th character for
initial encounter (A, B, C) for each encounter where the patient is
receiving active treatment for the fracture. The appropriate 7th character
for initial encounter should also be assigned for a patient who delayed
seeking treatment for the fracture or nonunion.
Fractures are coded using the appropriate 7th character for subsequent
care for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment of the
fracture and is receiving routine care for the fracture during the healing
or recovery phase.
Care for complications of surgical treatment for fracture repairs during
the healing or recovery phase should be coded with the appropriate
complication codes.
Care of complications of fractures, such as malunion and nonunion,
should be reported with the appropriate 7th character for subsequent care
with nonunion (K, M, N,) or subsequent care with malunion (P, Q, R).
Malunion/nonunion: The appropriate 7th character for initial encounter
should also be assigned for a patient who delayed seeking treatment for
the fracture or nonunion.
The open fracture designations in the assignment of the 7th character for
fractures of the forearm, femur and lower leg, including ankle are based
on the Gustilo open fracture classification. When the Gustilo
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 79 of 121

classification type is not specified for an open fracture, the 7th character
for open fracture type I or II should be assigned (B, E, H, M, Q).
A code from category M80, not a traumatic fracture code, should be used
for any patient with known osteoporosis who suffers a fracture, even if
the patient had a minor fall or trauma, if that fall or trauma would not
usually break a normal, healthy bone.
See Section I.C.13. Osteoporosis.
The aftercare Z codes should not be used for aftercare for traumatic
fractures. For aftercare of a traumatic fracture, assign the acute fracture
code with the appropriate 7th character.
2) Multiple fractures sequencing
Multiple fractures are sequenced in accordance with the severity of the
fracture.
3) Physeal fractures
For physeal fractures, assign only the code identifying the type of
physeal fracture. Do not assign a separate code to identify the specific
bone that is fractured.
d. Coding of Burns and Corrosions
The ICD-10-CM makes a distinction between burns and corrosions. The burn
codes are for thermal burns, except sunburns, that come from a heat source, such
as a fire or hot appliance. The burn codes are also for burns resulting from
electricity and radiation. Corrosions are burns due to chemicals. The guidelines
are the same for burns and corrosions.
Current burns (T20-T25) are classified by depth, extent and by agent (X code).
Burns are classified by depth as first degree (erythema), second degree
(blistering), and third degree (full-thickness involvement). Burns of the eye and
internal organs (T26-T28) are classified by site, but not by degree.
1) Sequencing of burn and related condition codes
Sequence first the code that reflects the highest degree of burn when
more than one burn is present.
a. When the reason for the admission or encounter is for treatment of
external multiple burns, sequence first the code that reflects the burn
of the highest degree.
b. When a patient has both internal and external burns, the
circumstances of admission govern the selection of the principal
diagnosis or first-listed diagnosis.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 80 of 121

c. When a patient is admitted for burn injuries and other related
conditions such as smoke inhalation and/or respiratory failure, the
circumstances of admission govern the selection of the principal or
first-listed diagnosis.
2) Burns of the same anatomic site
Classify burns of the same anatomic site and on the same side but of
different degrees to the subcategory identifying the highest degree
recorded in the diagnosis (e.g., for second and third degree burns of right
thigh, assign only code T24.311-).
3) Non-healing burns
Non-healing burns are coded as acute burns.
Necrosis of burned skin should be coded as a non-healed burn.
4) Infected burn
For any documented infected burn site, use an additional code for the
infection.
5) Assign separate codes for each burn site
When coding burns, assign separate codes for each burn site. Category
T30, Burn and corrosion, body region unspecified is extremely vague
and should rarely be used.
Codes for burns of "multiple sites" should only be assigned when the
medical record documentation does not specify the individual sites.
6) Burns and corrosions classified according to extent of body
surface involved
Assign codes from category T31, Burns classified according to extent of
body surface involved, or T32, Corrosions classified according to extent
of body surface involved, for acute burns or corrosions when the site of
the burn or corrosion is not specified or when there is a need for
additional data. It is advisable to use category T31 as additional coding
when needed to provide data for evaluating burn mortality, such as that
needed by burn units. It is also advisable to use category T31 as an
additional code for reporting purposes when there is mention of a third-
degree burn involving 20 percent or more of the body surface. Codes
from categories T31 and T32 should not be used for sequelae of burns or
corrosions.
Categories T31 and T32 are based on the classic “rule of nines” in
estimating body surface involved: head and neck are assigned nine
percent, each arm nine percent, each leg 18 percent, the anterior trunk 18
percent, posterior trunk 18 percent, and genitalia one percent. Providers
may change these percentage assignments where necessary to
accommodate infants and children who have proportionately larger heads
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 81 of 121

than adults, and patients who have large buttocks, thighs, or abdomen
that involve burns.
7) Encounters for treatment of sequela of burns
Encounters for the treatment of the late effects of burns or corrosions
(i.e., scars or joint contractures) should be coded with a burn or corrosion
code with the 7th character “S” for sequela.
8) Sequelae with a late effect code and current burn
When appropriate, both a code for a current burn or corrosion with 7th
character “A” or “D” and a burn or corrosion code with 7th character “S”
may be assigned on the same record (when both a current burn and
sequelae of an old burn exist). Burns and corrosions do not heal at the
same rate and a current healing wound may still exist with sequela of a
healed burn or corrosion.
See Section I.B.10. Sequela (Late Effects)
9) Use of an external cause code with burns and corrosions
An external cause code should be used with burns and corrosions to
identify the source and intent of the burn, as well as the place where it
occurred.
e. Adverse Effects, Poisoning, Underdosing and Toxic Effects
Codes in categories T36-T65 are combination codes that include the substance
that was taken as well as the intent. No additional external cause code is required
for poisonings, toxic effects, adverse effects and underdosing codes.
1) Do not code directly from the Table of Drugs
Do not code directly from the Table of Drugs and Chemicals. Always
refer back to the Tabular List.
2) Use as many codes as necessary to describe
Use as many codes as necessary to describe completely all drugs,
medicinal or biological substances.
3) If the same code would describe the causative agent
If the same code would describe the causative agent for more than one
adverse reaction, poisoning, toxic effect or underdosing, assign the code
only once.
4) If two or more drugs, medicinal or biological substances
If two or more drugs, medicinal or biological substances are taken, code
each individually unless a combination code is listed in the Table of
Drugs and Chemicals.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 82 of 121

If multiple unspecified drugs, medicinal or biological substances were
taken, assign the appropriate code from subcategory T50.91, Poisoning
by, adverse effect of and underdosing of multiple unspecified drugs,
medicaments and biological substances.
5) The occurrence of drug toxicity is classified in ICD-10-CM as
follows:
(a) Adverse Effect
When coding an adverse effect of a drug that has been correctly
prescribed and properly administered, assign the appropriate code
for the nature of the adverse effect followed by the appropriate
code for the adverse effect of the drug (T36-T50). The code for
the drug should have a 5th or 6th character “5” (for example
T36.0X5-) Examples of the nature of an adverse effect are
tachycardia, delirium, gastrointestinal hemorrhaging, vomiting,
hypokalemia, hepatitis, renal failure, or respiratory failure.
(b) Poisoning
When coding a poisoning or reaction to the improper use of a
medication (e.g., overdose, wrong substance given or taken in
error, wrong route of administration), first assign the appropriate
code from categories T36-T50. The poisoning codes have an
associated intent as their 5th or 6th character (accidental,
intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined). If the intent of
the poisoning is unknown or unspecified, code the intent as
accidental intent. The undetermined intent is only for use if the
documentation in the record specifies that the intent cannot be
determined. Use additional code(s) for all manifestations of
poisonings.
If there is also a diagnosis of abuse or dependence of the
substance, the abuse or dependence is assigned as an additional
code.
Examples of poisoning include:
(i) Error was made in drug prescription
Errors made in drug prescription or in the administration
of the drug by provider, nurse, patient, or other person.
(ii) Overdose of a drug intentionally taken
If an overdose of a drug was intentionally taken or
administered and resulted in drug toxicity, it would be
coded as a poisoning.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 83 of 121

(iii)Nonprescribed drug taken with correctly prescribed and
properly administered drug
If a nonprescribed drug or medicinal agent was taken in
combination with a correctly prescribed and properly
administered drug, any drug toxicity or other reaction
resulting from the interaction of the two drugs would be
classified as a poisoning.
(iv) Interaction of drug(s) and alcohol
When a reaction results from the interaction of a drug(s)
and alcohol, this would be classified as poisoning.
See Section I.C.4. if poisoning is the result of insulin
pump malfunctions.
For Sequela (Late Effects) see Section I.B.10.
(c) Underdosing
Underdosing refers to taking less of a medication than is
prescribed by a provider or a manufacturer’s instruction.
Discontinuing the use of a prescribed medication on the patient's
own initiative (not directed by the patient's provider) is also
classified as an underdosing. For underdosing, assign the code
from categories T36-T50 (fifth or sixth character “6”).
Documentation of a change in the patient’s condition is not
required in order to assign an underdosing code. Documentation
that the patient is taking less of a medication than is prescribed or
discontinued the prescribed medication is sufficient for code
assignment.
Codes for underdosing should never be assigned as principal or
first-listed codes. If a patient has a relapse or exacerbation of the
medical condition for which the drug is prescribed because of the
reduction in dose, then the medical condition itself should be
coded.
Noncompliance (Z91.12-, Z91.13-, Z91.14- and Z91.A4-) or
complication of care (Y63.6-Y63.9) codes are to be used with an
underdosing code to indicate intent, if known.
(d) Toxic Effects
When a harmful substance is ingested or comes in contact with a
person, this is classified as a toxic effect. The toxic effect codes
are in categories T51-T65. When coding a toxic effect, assign the
toxic effect code first, followed by codes for all associated
manifestations of the toxic effect.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 84 of 121

Toxic effect codes have an associated intent: accidental,
intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined.
For Sequela (Late Effects) see Section I.B.10. Sequela
f. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment
Sequence first the appropriate code from categories T74, Adult and child abuse,
neglect and other maltreatment, confirmed, or T76, Adult and child abuse,
neglect and other maltreatment, suspected, for abuse, neglect and other
maltreatment, followed by any accompanying mental health or injury code(s).
If the documentation in the medical record states abuse or neglect, it is coded as
confirmed (T74.-). It is coded as suspected if it is documented as suspected
(T76.-).
For cases of confirmed abuse or neglect an external cause code from the assault
section (X92-Y09) should be added to identify the cause of any physical
injuries. A perpetrator code (Y07) should be added when the perpetrator of the
abuse is known. For suspected cases of abuse or neglect, do not report external
cause or perpetrator code.
If a suspected case of abuse, neglect or mistreatment is ruled out during an
encounter code Z04.71, Encounter for examination and observation following
alleged physical adult abuse, ruled out, or code Z04.72, Encounter for
examination and observation following alleged child physical abuse, ruled out,
should be used, not a code from T76.
If a suspected case of alleged rape or sexual abuse is ruled out during an
encounter code Z04.41, Encounter for examination and observation following
alleged adult rape or code Z04.42, Encounter for examination and observation
following alleged child rape, should be used, not a code from T76.
If a suspected case of forced sexual exploitation or forced labor exploitation is
ruled out during an encounter, code Z04.81, Encounter for examination and
observation of victim following forced sexual exploitation, or code Z04.82,
Encounter for examination and observation of victim following forced labor
exploitation, should be used, not a code from T76.
See Section I.C.15. Abuse in a pregnant patient.
g. Complications of care
1) General guidelines for complications of care
(a) Documentation of complications of care
See Section I.B.16. for information on documentation of
complications of care.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 85 of 121

2) Pain due to medical devices
Pain associated with devices, implants or grafts left in a surgical site (for
example painful hip prosthesis) is assigned to the appropriate code(s)
found in Chapter 19, Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences
of external causes. Specific codes for pain due to medical devices are
found in the T code section of the ICD-10-CM. Use additional code(s)
from category G89 to identify acute or chronic pain due to presence of
the device, implant or graft (G89.18 or G89.28).
3) Transplant complications
(a) Transplant complications other than kidney
Codes under category T86, Complications of transplanted organs
and tissues, are for use for both complications and rejection of
transplanted organs. A transplant complication code is only
assigned if the complication affects the function of the
transplanted organ. Two codes are required to fully describe a
transplant complication: the appropriate code from category T86
and a secondary code that identifies the complication.
Pre-existing conditions or conditions that develop after the
transplant are not coded as complications unless they affect the
function of the transplanted organs.
See I.C.21. for transplant organ removal status
See I.C.2. for malignant neoplasm associated with transplanted
organ.
See I.C.1.d.4. for sequencing of sepsis due to infection in
transplanted organ
(b) Kidney transplant complications
Patients who have undergone kidney transplant may still have
some form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) because the kidney
transplant may not fully restore kidney function. Code T86.1-
should be assigned for documented complications of a kidney
transplant, such as transplant failure or rejection or other
transplant complication. Code T86.1- should not be assigned for
post kidney transplant patients who have chronic kidney (CKD)
unless a transplant complication such as transplant failure or
rejection is documented. If the documentation is unclear as to
whether the patient has a complication of the transplant, query the
provider.
Conditions that affect the function of the transplanted kidney,
other than CKD, should be assigned a code from subcategory
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 86 of 121

T86.1, Complications of transplanted organ, Kidney, and a
secondary code that identifies the complication.
For patients with CKD following a kidney transplant, but who do
not have a complication such as failure or rejection, see section
I.C.14. Chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant status.
See I.C.1.d.4. for sequencing of sepsis due to infection in
transplanted organ
4) Complication codes that include the external cause
As with certain other T codes, some of the complications of care codes
have the external cause included in the code. The code includes the
nature of the complication as well as the type of procedure that caused
the complication. No external cause code indicating the type of
procedure is necessary for these codes.
5) Complications of care codes within the body system chapters
Intraoperative and postprocedural complication codes are found within
the body system chapters with codes specific to the organs and structures
of that body system. These codes should be sequenced first, followed by
a code(s) for the specific complication, if applicable.
Complication codes from the body system chapters should be assigned
for intraoperative and postprocedural complications (e.g., the appropriate
complication code from chapter 9 would be assigned for a vascular
intraoperative or postprocedural complication) unless the complication is
specifically indexed to a T code in chapter 19.
20. Chapter 20: External Causes of Morbidity (V00-Y99)
The external causes of morbidity codes should never be sequenced as the first-listed or
principal diagnosis.
External cause codes are intended to provide data for injury research and evaluation of
injury prevention strategies. These codes capture how the injury or health condition
happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or accidental; or intentional, such as suicide
or assault), the place where the event occurred the activity of the patient at the time of
the event, and the person’s status (e.g., civilian, military).
There is no national requirement for mandatory ICD-10-CM external cause code
reporting. Unless a provider is subject to a state-based external cause code reporting
mandate or these codes are required by a particular payer, reporting of ICD-10-CM
codes in Chapter 20, External Causes of Morbidity, is not required. In the absence of a
mandatory reporting requirement, providers are encouraged to voluntarily report
external cause codes, as they provide valuable data for injury research and evaluation of
injury prevention strategies.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 87 of 121

a. General External Cause Coding Guidelines
1) Used with any code in the range of A00.0-T88.9, Z00-Z99
An external cause code may be used with any code in the range of
A00.0-T88.9, Z00-Z99, classification that represents a health condition
due to an external cause. Though they are most applicable to injuries,
they are also valid for use with such things as infections or diseases due
to an external source, and other health conditions, such as a heart attack
that occurs during strenuous physical activity.
2) External cause code used for length of treatment
Assign the external cause code, with the appropriate 7th character (initial
encounter, subsequent encounter or sequela) for each encounter for
which the injury or condition is being treated.
Most categories in chapter 20 have a 7th character requirement for each
applicable code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character
values: A, initial encounter, D, subsequent encounter and S, sequela.
While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the
course of treatment for an injury or condition, assignment of the 7th
character for external cause should match the 7th character of the code
assigned for the associated injury or condition for the encounter.
3) Use the full range of external cause codes
Use the full range of external cause codes to completely describe the
cause, the intent, the place of occurrence, and if applicable, the activity
of the patient at the time of the event, and the patient’s status, for all
injuries, and other health conditions due to an external cause.
4) Assign as many external cause codes as necessary
Assign as many external cause codes as necessary to fully explain each
cause. If only one external code can be recorded, assign the code most
related to the principal diagnosis.
5) The selection of the appropriate external cause code
The selection of the appropriate external cause code is guided by the
Alphabetic Index of External Causes and by Inclusion and Exclusion
notes in the Tabular List.
6) External cause code can never be a principal diagnosis
An external cause code can never be a principal (first-listed) diagnosis.
7) Combination external cause codes
Certain of the external cause codes are combination codes that identify
sequential events that result in an injury, such as a fall which results in
striking against an object. The injury may be due to either event or both.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 88 of 121

The combination external cause code used should correspond to the
sequence of events regardless of which caused the most serious injury.
8) No external cause code needed in certain circumstances
No external cause code from Chapter 20 is needed if the external cause
and intent are included in a code from another chapter (e.g., T36.0X1-,
Poisoning by penicillins, accidental (unintentional)).
b. Place of Occurrence Guideline
Codes from category Y92, Place of occurrence of the external cause, are
secondary codes for use after other external cause codes to identify the location
of the patient at the time of injury or other condition.
Generally, a place of occurrence code is assigned only once, at the initial
encounter for treatment. However, in the rare instance that a new injury occurs
during hospitalization, an additional place of occurrence code may be assigned.
No 7th characters are used for Y92.
Do not use place of occurrence code Y92.9 if the place is not stated or is not
applicable.
c. Activity Code
Assign a code from category Y93, Activity code, to describe the activity of the
patient at the time the injury or other health condition occurred.
An activity code is used only once, at the initial encounter for treatment. Only
one code from Y93 should be recorded on a medical record.
The activity codes are not applicable to poisonings, adverse effects,
misadventures or sequela.
Do not assign Y93.9, Unspecified activity, if the activity is not stated.
A code from category Y93 is appropriate for use with external cause and intent
codes if identifying the activity provides additional information about the event.
d. Place of Occurrence, Activity, and Status Codes Used with other
External Cause Code
When applicable, place of occurrence, activity, and external cause status codes
are sequenced after the main external cause code(s). Regardless of the number of
external cause codes assigned, generally there should be only one place of
occurrence code, one activity code, and one external cause status code assigned
to an encounter. However, in the rare instance that a new injury occurs during
hospitalization, an additional place of occurrence code may be assigned.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 89 of 121

e. If the Reporting Format Limits the Number of External Cause
Codes
If the reporting format limits the number of external cause codes that can be
used in reporting clinical data, report the code for the cause/intent most related
to the principal diagnosis. If the format permits capture of additional external
cause codes, the cause/intent, including medical misadventures, of the additional
events should be reported rather than the codes for place, activity, or external
status.
f. Multiple External Cause Coding Guidelines
More than one external cause code is required to fully describe the external
cause of an illness or injury. The assignment of external cause codes should be
sequenced in the following priority:
If two or more events cause separate injuries, an external cause code should be
assigned for each cause. The first-listed external cause code will be selected in
the following order:
External codes for child and adult abuse take priority over all other external
cause codes.
See Section I.C.19., Child and Adult abuse guidelines.
External cause codes for terrorism events take priority over all other external
cause codes except child and adult abuse.
External cause codes for cataclysmic events take priority over all other external
cause codes except child and adult abuse and terrorism.
External cause codes for transport accidents take priority over all other external
cause codes except cataclysmic events, child and adult abuse and terrorism.
Activity and external cause status codes are assigned following all causal
(intent) external cause codes.
The first-listed external cause code should correspond to the cause of the most
serious diagnosis due to an assault, accident, or self-harm, following the order of
hierarchy listed above.
g. Child and Adult Abuse Guideline
Adult and child abuse, neglect and maltreatment are classified as assault. Any of
the assault codes may be used to indicate the external cause of any injury
resulting from the confirmed abuse.
For confirmed cases of abuse, neglect and maltreatment, when the perpetrator is
known, a code from Y07, Perpetrator of maltreatment and neglect, should
accompany any other assault codes.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 90 of 121

See Section I.C.19. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment
h. Unknown or Undetermined Intent Guideline
If the intent (accident, self-harm, assault) of the cause of an injury or other
condition is unknown or unspecified, code the intent as accidental intent. All
transport accident categories assume accidental intent.
1) Use of undetermined intent
External cause codes for events of undetermined intent are only for use if
the documentation in the record specifies that the intent cannot be
determined.
i. Sequelae (Late Effects) of External Cause Guidelines
1) Sequelae external cause codes
Sequela are reported using the external cause code with the 7th character
“S” for sequela. These codes should be used with any report of a late
effect or sequela resulting from a previous injury.
See Section I.B.10. Sequela (Late Effects)
2) Sequela external cause code with a related current injury
A sequela external cause code should never be used with a related
current nature of injury code.
3) Use of sequela external cause codes for subsequent visits
Use a late effect external cause code for subsequent visits when a late
effect of the initial injury is being treated. Do not use a late effect
external cause code for subsequent visits for follow-up care (e.g., to
assess healing, to receive rehabilitative therapy) of the injury when no
late effect of the injury has been documented.
j. Terrorism Guidelines
1) Cause of injury identified by the Federal Government (FBI) as
terrorism
When the cause of an injury is identified by the Federal Government
(FBI) as terrorism, the first-listed external cause code should be a code
from category Y38, Terrorism. The definition of terrorism employed by
the FBI is found at the inclusion note at the beginning of category Y38.
Use additional code for place of occurrence (Y92.-). More than one Y38
code may be assigned if the injury is the result of more than one
mechanism of terrorism.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 91 of 121

2) Cause of an injury is suspected to be the result of terrorism
When the cause of an injury is suspected to be the result of terrorism a
code from category Y38 should not be assigned. Suspected cases should
be classified as assault.
3) Code Y38.9, Terrorism, secondary effects
Assign code Y38.9, Terrorism, secondary effects, for conditions
occurring subsequent to the terrorist event. This code should not be
assigned for conditions that are due to the initial terrorist act.
It is acceptable to assign code Y38.9 with another code from Y38 if there
is an injury due to the initial terrorist event and an injury that is a
subsequent result of the terrorist event.
k. External Cause Status
A code from category Y99, External cause status, should be assigned whenever
any other external cause code is assigned for an encounter, including an Activity
code, except for the events noted below. Assign a code from category Y99,
External cause status, to indicate the work status of the person at the time the
event occurred. The status code indicates whether the event occurred during
military activity, whether a non-military person was at work, whether an
individual including a student or volunteer was involved in a non-work activity
at the time of the causal event.
A code from Y99, External cause status, should be assigned, when applicable,
with other external cause codes, such as transport accidents and falls. The
external cause status codes are not applicable to poisonings, adverse effects,
misadventures or late effects.
Do not assign a code from category Y99 if no other external cause codes (cause,
activity) are applicable for the encounter.
An external cause status code is used only once, at the initial encounter for
treatment. Only one code from Y99 should be recorded on a medical record.
Do not assign code Y99.9, Unspecified external cause status, if the status is not
stated.
21. Chapter 21: Factors influencing health status and contact with health
services (Z00-Z99)
Note: The chapter specific guidelines provide additional information about the use of Z
codes for specified encounters.
a. Use of Z Codes in Any Healthcare Setting
Z codes are for use in any healthcare setting. Z codes may be used as either a
first-listed (principal diagnosis code in the inpatient setting) or secondary code,
depending on the circumstances of the encounter. Certain Z codes may only be
used as first-listed or principal diagnosis.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 92 of 121

b. Z Codes Indicate a Reason for an Encounter or Provide
Additional Information about a Patient Encounter
Z codes are not procedure codes. A corresponding procedure code must
accompany a Z code to describe any procedure performed.
c. Categories of Z Codes
1) Contact/Exposure
Category Z20 indicates contact with, and suspected exposure to,
communicable diseases. These codes are for patients who are suspected
to have been exposed to a disease by close personal contact with an
infected individual or are in an area where a disease is epidemic.
Category Z77, Other contact with and (suspected) exposures hazardous
to health, indicates contact with and suspected exposures hazardous to
health.
Contact/exposure codes may be used as a first-listed code to explain an
encounter for testing, or, more commonly, as a secondary code to
identify a potential risk.
2) Inoculations and vaccinations
Code Z23 is for encounters for inoculations and vaccinations. It indicates
that a patient is being seen to receive a prophylactic inoculation against a
disease. Procedure codes are required to identify the actual
administration of the injection and the type(s) of immunizations given.
Code Z23 may be used as a secondary code if the inoculation is given as
a routine part of preventive health care, such as a well-baby visit.
3) Status
Status codes indicate that a patient is either a carrier of a disease or has
the sequelae or residual of a past disease or condition. This includes such
things as the presence of prosthetic or mechanical devices resulting from
past treatment. A status code is informative, because the status may
affect the course of treatment and its outcome. A status code is distinct
from a history code. The history code indicates that the patient no longer
has the condition.
A status code should not be used with a diagnosis code from one of the
body system chapters, if the diagnosis code includes the information
provided by the status code. For example, code Z94.1, Heart transplant
status, should not be used with a code from subcategory T86.2,
Complications of heart transplant. The status code does not provide
additional information. The complication code indicates that the patient
is a heart transplant patient.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 93 of 121

For encounters for weaning from a mechanical ventilator, assign a code
from subcategory J96.1, Chronic respiratory failure, followed by code
Z99.11, Dependence on respirator [ventilator] status.
The status Z codes/categories are:
Z14 Genetic carrier
Genetic carrier status indicates that a person carries a gene,
associated with a particular disease, which may be passed to
offspring who may develop that disease. The person does not
have the disease and is not at risk of developing the disease.
Z15 Genetic susceptibility to disease
Genetic susceptibility indicates that a person has a gene that
increases the risk of that person developing the disease.
Codes from category Z15 should generally not be used as
principal or first-listed codes. If the patient has the condition
to which he/she is susceptible, and that condition is the reason
for the encounter, the code for the current condition should be
sequenced first. If the patient is being seen for follow-up after
completed treatment for this condition, and the condition no
longer exists, a follow-up code should be sequenced first,
followed by the appropriate personal history and genetic
susceptibility codes. If the purpose of the encounter is genetic
counseling associated with procreative management, code
Z31.5, Encounter for genetic counseling, should be assigned
as the first-listed code, followed by a code from category
Z15. Additional codes should be assigned for any applicable
family or personal history.
Z16 Resistance to antimicrobial drugs
This category indicates that a patient has a condition that is
resistant to antimicrobial drug treatment. Sequence the
infection code first.
Z17 Estrogen, and other hormones and factors receptor status
Z18 Retained foreign body fragments
Z19 Hormone sensitivity malignancy status
Z21 Asymptomatic HIV infection status
This code indicates that a patient has tested positive for HIV
but has manifested no signs or symptoms of the disease.
Z22 Carrier of infectious disease
Carrier status indicates that a person harbors the specific
organisms of a disease without manifest symptoms and is
capable of transmitting the infection.
Z28.3 Underimmunization status
See Section I.B.14. for underimmunization documentation by
clinicians other than the patient’s provider.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 94 of 121

Z33.1 Pregnant state, incidental
This code is a secondary code only for use when the
pregnancy is in no way complicating the reason for visit.
Otherwise, a code from the obstetric chapter is required.
Z66 Do not resuscitate
This code may be used when it is documented by the provider
that a patient is on do not resuscitate status at any time during
the stay.
Z67 Blood type
Z68 Body mass index (BMI)
BMI codes should only be assigned when there is an
associated, reportable diagnosis (such as obesity or anorexia)
documented by the patient’s provider.
Do not assign BMI codes during pregnancy. When the
documentation reflects fluctuating BMI values during the
current encounter for an associated reportable condition,
assign a code for the most severe value.
See Section I.B.14. for BMI documentation by clinicians other
than the patient’s provider.
Z74.01 Bed confinement status
Z76.82 Awaiting organ transplant status
Z78 Other specified health status
Code Z78.1, Physical restraint status, may be used when it is
documented by the provider that a patient has been put in
restraints during the current encounter. Please note that this
code should not be reported when it is documented by the
provider that a patient is temporarily restrained during a
procedure.
Z79 Long-term (current) drug therapy
Codes from this category indicate a patient’s continuous use
of a prescribed drug (including such things as aspirin therapy)
for the long-term treatment of a condition or for prophylactic
use. It is not for use for patients who have addictions to drugs.
This subcategory is not for use of medications for
detoxification or maintenance programs to prevent
withdrawal symptoms (e.g., methadone maintenance for
opiate dependence). Assign the appropriate code for the drug
use, abuse, or dependence instead.
Assign a code from Z79 if the patient is receiving a
medication for an extended period as a prophylactic measure
(such as for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis) or as
treatment of a chronic condition (such as arthritis) or a
disease requiring a lengthy course of treatment (such as
cancer). Do not assign a code from category Z79 for
medication being administered for a brief period of time to
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 95 of 121

treat an acute illness or injury (such as a course of antibiotics
to treat acute bronchitis).
Z88 Allergy status to drugs, medicaments and biological
substances
Except: Z88.9, Allergy status to unspecified drugs,
medicaments and biological substances status
Z89 Acquired absence of limb
Z90 Acquired absence of organs, not elsewhere classified
Z91.0- Allergy status, other than to drugs and biological substances
Z92.82 Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility
within the last 24 hours prior to admission to a current facility
Assign code Z92.82, Status post administration of tPA (rtPA)
in a different facility within the last 24 hours prior to
admission to current facility, as a secondary diagnosis when a
patient is received by transfer into a facility and
documentation indicates they were administered tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) within the last 24 hours prior to
admission to the current facility.
This guideline applies even if the patient is still receiving the
tPA at the time they are received into the current facility.
The appropriate code for the condition for which the tPA was
administered (such as cerebrovascular disease or myocardial
infarction) should be assigned first.
Code Z92.82 is only applicable to the receiving facility record
and not to the transferring facility record.
Z93 Artificial opening status
Z94 Transplanted organ and tissue status
Z95 Presence of cardiac and vascular implants and grafts
Z96 Presence of other functional implants
Z97 Presence of other devices
Z98 Other postprocedural states
Assign code Z98.85, Transplanted organ removal status, to
indicate that a transplanted organ has been previously
removed. This code should not be assigned for the encounter
in which the transplanted organ is removed. The complication
necessitating removal of the transplant organ should be
assigned for that encounter.
See section I.C.19. for information on the coding of organ
transplant complications.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 96 of 121

Z99 Dependence on enabling machines and devices, not elsewhere
classified
Note: Categories Z89-Z90 and Z93-Z99 are for use only if
there are no complications or malfunctions of the organ or
tissue replaced, the amputation site or the equipment on
which the patient is dependent.
4) History (of)
There are two types of history Z codes, personal and family. Personal
history codes explain a patient’s past medical condition that no longer
exists and is not receiving any treatment, but that has the potential for
recurrence, and therefore may require continued monitoring.
Family history codes are for use when a patient has a family member(s)
who has had a particular disease that causes the patient to be at higher
risk of also contracting the disease.
Personal history codes may be used in conjunction with follow-up codes
and family history codes may be used in conjunction with screening
codes to explain the need for a test or procedure. History codes are also
acceptable on any medical record regardless of the reason for visit. A
history of an illness, even if no longer present, is important information
that may alter the type of treatment ordered.
The reason for the encounter (for example, screening or counseling)
should be sequenced first and the appropriate personal and/or family
history code(s) should be assigned as additional diagnos(es).
The history Z code categories are:
Z80 Family history of primary malignant neoplasm
Z81 Family history of mental and behavioral disorders
Z82 Family history of certain disabilities and chronic diseases
(leading to disablement)
Z83 Family history of other specific disorders
Z84 Family history of other conditions
Z85 Personal history of malignant neoplasm
Z86 Personal history of certain other diseases
Z87 Personal history of other diseases and conditions
Z91.4- Personal history of psychological trauma, not elsewhere
classified
Z91.5- Personal history of self-harm
Z91.81 History of falling
Z91.82 Personal history of military deployment
Z91.85 Personal history of military service
Z92 Personal history of medical treatment
Except: Z92.0, Personal history of contraception
Except: Z92.82, Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a
different facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to
a current facility
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 97 of 121

5) Screening
Screening is the testing for disease or disease precursors in seemingly
well individuals so that early detection and treatment can be provided for
those who test positive for the disease (e.g., screening mammogram).
The testing of a person to rule out or confirm a suspected diagnosis
because the patient has some sign or symptom is a diagnostic
examination, not a screening. In these cases, the sign or symptom is used
to explain the reason for the test.
A screening code may be a first-listed code if the reason for the visit is
specifically the screening exam. It may also be used as an additional
code if the screening is done during an office visit for other health
problems. A screening code is not necessary if the screening is inherent
to a routine examination, such as a pap smear done during a routine
pelvic examination.
Should a condition be discovered during the screening then the code for
the condition may be assigned as an additional diagnosis.
The Z code indicates that a screening exam is planned. A procedure code
is required to confirm that the screening was performed.
The screening Z codes/categories:
Z11 Encounter for screening for infectious and parasitic diseases
Z12 Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasms
Z13 Encounter for screening for other diseases and disorders
Except: Z13.9, Encounter for screening, unspecified
Z36 Encounter for antenatal screening for mother
6) Observation
There are three observation Z code categories. They are for use in very
limited circumstances when a person is being observed for a suspected
condition that is ruled out. The observation codes are not for use if an
injury or illness or any signs or symptoms related to the suspected
condition are present. In such cases the diagnosis/symptom code is used
with the corresponding external cause code.
The observation codes are primarily to be used as a principal/first-listed
diagnosis. An observation code may be assigned as a secondary
diagnosis code when the patient is being observed for a condition that is
ruled out and is unrelated to the principal/first-listed diagnosis. Also,
when the principal diagnosis is required to be a code from category Z38,
Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of delivery, then a
code from category Z05, Encounter for observation and evaluation of
newborn for suspected diseases and conditions ruled out, is sequenced
after the Z38 code. Additional codes may be used in addition to the
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 98 of 121

observation code, but only if they are unrelated to the suspected
condition being observed.
Codes from subcategory Z03.7, Encounter for suspected maternal and
fetal conditions ruled out, may either be used as a first-listed or as an
additional code assignment depending on the case. They are for use in
very limited circumstances on a maternal record when an encounter is for
a suspected maternal or fetal condition that is ruled out during that
encounter (for example, a maternal or fetal condition may be suspected
due to an abnormal test result). These codes should not be used when the
condition is confirmed. In those cases, the confirmed condition should be
coded. In addition, these codes are not for use if an illness or any signs or
symptoms related to the suspected condition or problem are present. In
such cases the diagnosis/symptom code is used.
Additional codes may be used in addition to the code from subcategory
Z03.7, but only if they are unrelated to the suspected condition being
evaluated.
Codes from subcategory Z03.7 may not be used for encounters for
antenatal screening of mother. See Section I.C.21. Screening.
For encounters for suspected fetal condition that are inconclusive
following testing and evaluation, assign the appropriate code from
category O35, O36, O40 or O41.
The observation Z code categories:
Z03 Encounter for medical observation for suspected diseases and
conditions ruled out
Z04 Encounter for examination and observation for other reasons
Except: Z04.9, Encounter for examination and observation for
unspecified reason
Z05 Encounter for observation and evaluation of newborn for
suspected diseases and conditions ruled out
7) Aftercare
Aftercare visit codes cover situations when the initial treatment of a
disease has been performed and the patient requires continued care
during the healing or recovery phase, or for the long-term consequences
of the disease. The aftercare Z code should not be used if treatment is
directed at a current, acute disease. The diagnosis code is to be used in
these cases.
The aftercare Z codes should also not be used for aftercare for injuries.
For aftercare of an injury, assign the acute injury code with the
appropriate 7th character (for subsequent encounter).
The aftercare codes are generally first listed to explain the specific
reason for the encounter. An aftercare code may be reported as an
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 99 of 121

additional code when a specific type of aftercare is provided in addition
to the reason for the encounter. An example of this would be the closure
of a colostomy during an encounter for treatment of another condition.
Aftercare codes should be used in conjunction with other aftercare codes
or diagnosis codes to provide better detail on the specifics of an aftercare
encounter visit, unless otherwise directed by the classification. The
sequencing of multiple aftercare codes depends on the circumstances of
the encounter.
Certain aftercare Z code categories need a secondary diagnosis code to
describe the resolving condition or sequelae. For others, the condition is
included in the code title.
Additional Z code aftercare category terms include fitting and
adjustment, and attention to artificial openings.
Status Z codes may be used with aftercare Z codes to indicate the nature
of the aftercare. For example, code Z95.1, Presence of aortocoronary
bypass graft, may be used with code Z48.812, Encounter for surgical
aftercare following surgery on the circulatory system, to indicate the
surgery for which the aftercare is being performed. A status code should
not be used when the aftercare code indicates the type of status, such as
using Z43.0, Encounter for attention to tracheostomy, with Z93.0,
Tracheostomy status.
The aftercare codes are generally found in the following categories:
Z42 Encounter for plastic and reconstructive surgery following
medical procedure or healed injury
Z43 Encounter for attention to artificial openings
Z44 Encounter for fitting and adjustment of external prosthetic
device
Z45 Encounter for adjustment and management of implanted
device
Z46 Encounter for fitting and adjustment of other devices
Z47 Orthopedic aftercare
Z48 Encounter for other postprocedural aftercare
Z49 Encounter for care involving renal dialysis
Z51 Encounter for other aftercare and medical care
8) Follow-up
The follow-up codes are used to explain continuing surveillance
following completed treatment of a disease, condition, or injury. They
imply that the condition has been fully treated and no longer exists. They
should not be confused with aftercare codes, or injury codes with a 7th
character for subsequent encounter, that explain ongoing care of a
healing condition or its sequelae. Follow-up codes may be used in
conjunction with history codes to provide the full picture of the healed
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 100 of 121

condition and its treatment. The follow-up code is sequenced first,
followed by the history code.
A follow-up code may be used to explain multiple visits. Should a
condition be found to have recurred on the follow-up visit, then the
diagnosis code for the condition should be assigned in place of the
follow-up code.
The follow-up Z codes/categories:
Z08 Encounter for follow-up examination after completed
treatment for malignant neoplasm
Z09 Encounter for follow-up examination after completed
treatment for conditions other than malignant neoplasm
Codes Z08, Encounter for follow-up examination after completed
treatment for malignant neoplasm, and Z09, Encounter for follow
up examination after completed treatment for conditions other than
malignant neoplasm, may be assigned following any type of
completed treatment modality (including both medical and surgical
treatments).
Z39 Encounter for maternal postpartum care and examination
9) Donor
Codes in category Z52, Donors of organs and tissues, are used for living
individuals who are donating blood or other body tissue. These codes are
for individuals donating for others, as well as for self-donations. They
are not used to identify cadaveric donations.
10) Counseling
Counseling Z codes are used when a patient or family member receives
assistance in the aftermath of an illness or injury, or when support is
required in coping with family or social problems.
The counseling Z codes/categories:
Z30.0- Encounter for general counseling and advice on contraception
Z31.5 Encounter for procreative genetic counseling
Z31.6- Encounter for general counseling and advice on procreation
Z32.2 Encounter for childbirth instruction
Z32.3 Encounter for childcare instruction
Z69 Encounter for mental health services for victim and
perpetrator of abuse
Z70 Counseling related to sexual attitude, behavior and orientation
Z71 Persons encountering health services for other counseling and
medical advice, not elsewhere classified
Note: Code Z71.84, Encounter for health counseling related
to travel, is to be used for health risk and safety counseling
for future travel purposes.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 101 of 121

Code Z71.85, Encounter for immunization safety counseling,
is to be used for counseling of the patient or caregiver
regarding the safety of a vaccine. This code should not be
used for the provision of general information regarding risks
and potential side effects during routine encounters for the
administration of vaccines.
Code Z71.87, Encounter for pediatric-to-adult transition
counseling, should be assigned when pediatric-to-adult
transition counseling is the sole reason for the encounter or
when this counseling is provided in addition to other services,
such as treatment of a chronic condition. If both transition
counseling and treatment of a medical condition are provided
during the same encounter, the code(s) for the medical
condition(s) treated and code Z71.87 should be assigned, with
sequencing depending on the circumstances of the encounter.
Z76.81 Expectant mother prebirth pediatrician visit
11) Encounters for Obstetrical and Reproductive Services
See Section I.C.15. Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium, for
further instruction on the use of these codes.
Z codes for pregnancy are for use in those circumstances when none of
the problems or complications included in the codes from the Obstetrics
chapter exist (a routine prenatal visit or postpartum care). Codes in
category Z34, Encounter for supervision of normal pregnancy, are
always first listed and are not to be used with any other code from the
OB chapter.
Codes in category Z3A, Weeks of gestation, may be assigned to provide
additional information about the pregnancy. Category Z3A codes should
not be assigned for pregnancies with abortive outcomes (categories O00-
O08), elective termination of pregnancy (code Z33.2), nor for
postpartum conditions, as category Z3A is not applicable to these
conditions. The date of the admission should be used to determine weeks
of gestation for inpatient admissions that encompass more than one
gestational week.
The outcome of delivery, category Z37, should be included on all
maternal delivery records. It is always a secondary code.
Codes in category Z37 should not be used on the newborn record.
Z codes for family planning (contraceptive) or procreative management
and counseling should be included on an obstetric record either during
the pregnancy or the postpartum stage, if applicable.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 102 of 121

Z codes/categories for obstetrical and reproductive services:
Z30 Encounter for contraceptive management
Z31 Encounter for procreative management
Z32.2 Encounter for childbirth instruction
Z32.3 Encounter for childcare instruction
Z33 Pregnant state
Z34 Encounter for supervision of normal pregnancy
Z36 Encounter for antenatal screening of mother
Z3A Weeks of gestation
Z37 Outcome of delivery
Z39 Encounter for maternal postpartum care and examination
Z76.81 Expectant mother prebirth pediatrician visit
12) Routine and Administrative Examinations
The Z codes allow for the description of encounters for routine
examinations, such as, a general check-up, or, examinations for
administrative purposes, such as, a pre-employment physical. The codes
are not to be used if the examination is for diagnosis of a suspected
condition or for treatment purposes. In such cases the diagnosis code is
used. During a routine exam, should a diagnosis or condition be
discovered, it should be coded as an additional code. Pre-existing and
chronic conditions and history codes may also be included as additional
codes as long as the examination is for administrative purposes and not
focused on any particular condition.
Some of the codes for routine health examinations distinguish between
“with” and “without” abnormal findings. Code assignment depends on
the information that is known at the time the encounter is being coded.
For example, if no abnormal findings were found during the
examination, but the encounter is being coded before test results are
back, it is acceptable to assign the code for “without abnormal findings.”
When assigning a code for “with abnormal findings,” additional code(s)
should be assigned to identify the specific abnormal finding(s).
Pre-operative examination and pre-procedural laboratory examination Z
codes are for use only in those situations when a patient is being cleared
for a procedure or surgery and no treatment is given.
The Z codes/categories for routine and administrative examinations:
Z00 Encounter for general examination without complaint,
suspected or reported diagnosis
Z01 Encounter for other special examination without complaint,
suspected or reported diagnosis
Z02 Encounter for administrative examination
Except: Z02.9, Encounter for administrative examinations,
unspecified
Z32.0- Encounter for pregnancy test
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 103 of 121

13) Miscellaneous Z Codes
The miscellaneous Z codes capture a number of other health care
encounters that do not fall into one of the other categories. Some of these
codes identify the reason for the encounter; others are for use as
additional codes that provide useful information on circumstances that
may affect a patient’s care and treatment.
Prophylactic Organ Removal
For encounters specifically for prophylactic removal of an organ (such as
prophylactic removal of breasts due to a genetic susceptibility to cancer
or a family history of cancer), the principal or first-listed code should be
a code from subcategory Z40.0, Encounter for prophylactic surgery for
risk factors related to malignant neoplasms, or subcategory Z40.8,
Encounter for other prophylactic surgery. If applicable, assign
additional code(s) to identify any associated risk factor (such as
genetic susceptibility or family history).
If the patient has a malignancy of one site and is having prophylactic
removal at another site to prevent either a new primary malignancy or
metastatic disease, a code for the malignancy should also be assigned in
addition to a code from subcategory Z40.0, Encounter for prophylactic
surgery for risk factors related to malignant neoplasms. A Z40.0 code
should not be assigned if the patient is having organ removal for
treatment of a malignancy, such as the removal of the testes for the
treatment of prostate cancer.
Miscellaneous Z codes/subcategories/categories:
Z28 Immunization not carried out
Except: Z28.3-, Underimmunization status
Z29 Encounter for other prophylactic measures
Z40 Encounter for prophylactic surgery
Z41 Encounter for procedures for purposes other than remedying
health state
Except: Z41.9, Encounter for procedure for purposes other
than remedying health state, unspecified
Z53 Persons encountering health services for specific procedures
and treatment, not carried out
Z72 Problems related to lifestyle
Note: These codes should be assigned only when the
documentation specifies that the patient has an associated
problem
Z73 Problems related to life management difficulty
Note: These codes should be assigned only when the
documentation specifies that the patient has an associated
problem.
Z74 Problems related to care provider dependency
Except: Z74.01, Bed confinement status
Z75 Problems related to medical facilities and other health care
Z76.0 Encounter for issue of repeat prescription

Z91.89 Other specified personal risk factors, not elsewhere classified
See Section I.B.14. for Z55-Z65 Persons with potential health hazards
related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances,
documentation by clinicians other than the patient’s provider
14) Nonspecific Z Codes
Certain Z codes are so non-specific, or potentially redundant with other
codes in the classification, that there can be little justification for their
use in the inpatient setting. Their use in the outpatient setting should be
limited to those instances when there is no further documentation to
permit more precise coding. Otherwise, any sign or symptom or any
other reason for visit that is captured in another code should be used.
Nonspecific Z codes/categories:
Z02.9 Encounter for administrative examinations, unspecified
Z04.9 Encounter for examination and observation for unspecified
reason
Z13.9 Encounter for screening, unspecified
Z41.9 Encounter for procedure for purposes other than remedying
health state, unspecified
Z52.9 Donor of unspecified organ or tissue
Z86.59 Personal history of other mental and behavioral disorders
Z88.9 Allergy status to unspecified drugs, medicaments and
biological substances status
Z92.0 Personal history of contraception
15) Z Codes That May Only be Principal/First-Listed Diagnosis
The following Z codes/subcategories/categories may only be reported
as the principal/first-listed diagnosis, except when there are multiple
encounters on the same day and the medical records for the encounters
are combined:
Z00 Encounter for general examination without complaint,
suspected or reported diagnosis
Except: Z00.6
Z01 Encounter for other special examination without complaint,
suspected or reported diagnosis
Z02 Encounter for administrative examination

power failure

See Section I.C.16. Newborn (Perinatal) Guidelines, for further
instruction on the use of these codes.
Newborn Z codes/subcategories/categories:
Z76.1 Encounter for health supervision and care of foundling
Z00.1- Encounter for routine child health examination
Z38 Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of
delivery
17) Social Determinants of Health
Social determinants of health (SDOH) codes describing social problems,
conditions, or risk factors that influence a patient’s health should be
assigned when this information is documented in the patient’s medical
record. Assign as many SDOH codes as are necessary to describe all of
the social problems, conditions, or risk factors documented during the
current episode of care. For example, a patient who lives alone may
suffer an acute injury temporarily impacting their ability to perform
routine activities of daily living. When documented as such, this would
support assignment of code Z60.2, Problems related to living alone.
However, merely living alone, without documentation of a risk or unmet
need for assistance at home, would not support assignment of code
Z60.2. Documentation by a clinician (or patient-reported information
that is signed off by a clinician) that the patient expressed concerns with
access and availability of food would support assignment of code
Z59.41, Food insecurity. Similarly, medical record documentation
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 106 of 121

indicating the patient is experiencing homelessness would support
assignment of a code from subcategory Z59.0-, Homelessness.
For social determinants of health classified to chapter 21, such as
information found in categories Z55-Z65, Persons with potential health
hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances, code
assignment may be based on medical record documentation from
clinicians involved in the care of the patient who are not the patient’s
provider since this information represents social information, rather than
medical diagnoses. For example, coding professionals may utilize
documentation of social information from social workers, community
health workers, case managers, or nurses, if their documentation is
included in the official medical record.
Patient self-reported documentation may be used to assign codes for
social determinants of health, as long as the patient self-reported
information is signed-off by and incorporated into the medical record by
either a clinician or provider.
Social determinants of health codes are located primarily in these Z code
categories:
Z55 Problems related to education and literacy
Z56 Problems related to employment and unemployment
Z57 Occupational exposure to risk factors
Z58 Problems related to physical environment
Z59 Problems related to housing and economic circumstances
Z60 Problems related to social environment
Z62 Problems related to upbringing
Z63 Other problems related to primary support group, including
family circumstances
Z64 Problems related to certain psychosocial circumstances
Z65 Problems related to other psychosocial circumstances
See Section I.B.14. Documentation by Clinicians Other than the Patient's
Provider.

U07.0 Vaping-related disorder (see Section I.C.10.e., Vaping-related disorders)
U07.1 COVID-19 (see Section I.C.1.g.1., COVID-19 infection)
U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified (see Section I.C.1.g.1.m.)
Section II. Selection of Principal Diagnosis
The circumstances of inpatient admission always govern the selection of principal diagnosis. The principal
diagnosis is defined in the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) as “that condition established
after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care.”
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 107 of 121

The UHDDS definitions are used by hospitals to report inpatient data elements in a standardized manner.
These data elements and their definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985, Federal Register (Vol. 50, No,
147), pp. 31038-40.
Since that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded to include all non-outpatient
settings (acute care, short term, long term care and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab
facilities; nursing homes, etc.). The UHDDS definitions also apply to hospice services (all levels of care).
In determining principal diagnosis, coding conventions in the ICD-10-CM, the Tabular List and
Alphabetic Index take precedence over these official coding guidelines.
(See Section I.A., Conventions for the ICD-10-CM)
The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized.
Without such documentation the application of all coding guidelines is a difficult, if not impossible, task.
A. Codes for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions
Codes for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions from Chapter 18 are not to be used as
principal diagnosis when a related definitive diagnosis has been established.
B. Two or more interrelated conditions, each potentially meeting the
definition for principal diagnosis.
When there are two or more interrelated conditions (such as diseases in the same ICD-10-CM
chapter or manifestations characteristically associated with a certain disease) potentially
meeting the definition of principal diagnosis, either condition may be sequenced first, unless
the circumstances of the admission, the therapy provided, the Tabular List, or the Alphabetic
Index indicate otherwise.
C. Two or more diagnoses that equally meet the definition for principal
diagnosis
In the unusual instance when two or more diagnoses equally meet the criteria for principal
diagnosis as determined by the circumstances of admission, diagnostic workup and/or therapy
provided, and the Alphabetic Index, Tabular List, or another coding guidelines does not provide
sequencing direction, any one of the diagnoses may be sequenced first.
D. Two or more comparative or contrasting conditions
In those rare instances when two or more contrasting or comparative diagnoses are documented
as “either/or” (or similar terminology), they are coded as if the diagnoses were confirmed and
the diagnoses are sequenced according to the circumstances of the admission. If no further
determination can be made as to which diagnosis should be principal, either diagnosis may be
sequenced first.
E. A symptom(s) followed by contrasting/comparative diagnoses
GUIDELINE HAS BEEN DELETED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2014
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 108 of 121

F. Original treatment plan not carried out
Sequence as the principal diagnosis the condition, which after study occasioned the admission
to the hospital, even though treatment may not have been carried out due to unforeseen
circumstances.
G. Complications of surgery and other medical care
When the admission is for treatment of a complication resulting from surgery or other medical
care, the complication code is sequenced as the principal diagnosis. If the complication is
classified to the T80-T88 series and the code lacks the necessary specificity in describing the
complication, an additional code for the specific complication should be assigned.
H. Uncertain Diagnosis
If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as “probable,” “suspected,”
“likely,” “questionable,” “possible,” or “still to be ruled out,” “compatible with,” “consistent
with,” or other similar terms indicating uncertainty, code the condition as if it existed or was
established. The bases for these guidelines are the diagnostic workup, arrangements for further
workup or observation, and initial therapeutic approach that correspond most closely with the
established diagnosis.
Note: This guideline is applicable only to inpatient admissions to short-term, acute, long-term
care and psychiatric hospitals.
I. Admission from Observation Unit
1. Admission Following Medical Observation
When a patient is admitted to an observation unit for a medical condition, which either
worsens or does not improve, and is subsequently admitted as an inpatient of the same
hospital for this same medical condition, the principal diagnosis would be the medical
condition which led to the hospital admission.
2. Admission Following Post-Operative Observation
When a patient is admitted to an observation unit to monitor a condition (or
complication) that develops following outpatient surgery, and then is subsequently
admitted as an inpatient of the same hospital, hospitals should apply the Uniform
Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of principal diagnosis as "that
condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission
of the patient to the hospital for care."
J. Admission from Outpatient Surgery
When a patient receives surgery in the hospital's outpatient surgery department and is
subsequently admitted for continuing inpatient care at the same hospital, the following
guidelines should be followed in selecting the principal diagnosis for the inpatient admission:
• If the reason for the inpatient admission is a complication, assign the complication
as the principal diagnosis.
• If no complication, or other condition, is documented as the reason for the inpatient
admission, assign the reason for the outpatient surgery as the principal diagnosis.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 109 of 121

• If the reason for the inpatient admission is another condition unrelated to the
surgery, assign the unrelated condition as the principal diagnosis.
K. Admissions/Encounters for Rehabilitation
When the purpose for the admission/encounter is rehabilitation, sequence first the code for the
condition for which the service is being performed. For example, for an admission/encounter
for rehabilitation for right-sided dominant hemiplegia following a cerebrovascular infarction,
report code I69.351, Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting right
dominant side, as the first-listed or principal diagnosis.
If the condition for which the rehabilitation service is being provided is no longer present,
report the appropriate aftercare code as the first-listed or principal diagnosis, unless the
rehabilitation service is being provided following an injury. For rehabilitation services
following active treatment of an injury, assign the injury code with the appropriate seventh
character for subsequent encounter as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. For example, if a
patient with severe degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip, underwent hip replacement and the
current encounter/admission is for rehabilitation, report code Z47.1, Aftercare following joint
replacement surgery, as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. If the patient requires
rehabilitation post hip replacement for right intertrochanteric femur fracture, report code
S72.141D, Displaced intertrochanteric fracture of right femur, subsequent encounter for closed
fracture with routine healing, as the first-listed or principal diagnosis.
See Section I.C.21.c.7., Factors influencing health states and contact with health services,
Aftercare.
See Section I.C.19.a., for additional information about the use of 7th characters for injury
codes.
Section III. Reporting Additional Diagnoses
GENERAL RULES FOR OTHER (ADDITIONAL) DIAGNOSES
For reporting purposes, the definition for “other diagnoses” is interpreted as additional clinically
significant conditions that affect patient care in terms of requiring:
clinical evaluation; or
therapeutic treatment; or
diagnostic procedures; or
extended length of hospital stay; or
increased nursing care and/or monitoring.
The UHDDS item #11-b defines Other Diagnoses as “all conditions that coexist at the time of admission,
that develop subsequently, or that affect the treatment received and/or the length of stay. Diagnoses that
relate to an earlier episode which have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be excluded.” UHDDS
definitions apply to inpatients in acute care, short-term, long term care and psychiatric hospital setting. The
UHDDS definitions are used by acute care short-term hospitals to report inpatient data elements in a
standardized manner. These data elements and their definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985, Federal
Register (Vol. 50, No, 147), pp. 31038-40.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 110 of 121

Since that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded to include all non-outpatient
settings (acute care, short term, long term care and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab
facilities; nursing homes, etc.). The UHDDS definitions also apply to hospice services (all levels of care).
The following guidelines are to be applied in designating “other diagnoses” when neither the Alphabetic
Index nor the Tabular List in ICD-10-CM provide direction. The listing of the diagnoses in the patient
record is the responsibility of the provider.
A. Previous conditions
If the provider has included a diagnosis in the final diagnostic statement, such as the discharge
summary or the face sheet, it should ordinarily be coded. Some providers include in the
diagnostic statement resolved conditions or diagnoses and status-post procedures from previous
admissions that have no bearing on the current stay. Such conditions are not to be reported and
are coded only if required by hospital policy.
However, history codes (categories Z80-Z87) may be used as secondary codes if the historical
condition or family history has an impact on current care or influences treatment.
B. Abnormal findings
Abnormal findings (laboratory, x-ray, pathologic, and other diagnostic results) are not coded
and reported unless the provider indicates their clinical significance. If the findings are outside
the normal range and the provider has ordered other tests to evaluate the condition or prescribed
treatment, it is appropriate to ask the provider whether the abnormal finding should be added.
Please note: This differs from the coding practices in the outpatient setting for coding
encounters for diagnostic tests that have been interpreted by a provider.
C. Uncertain Diagnosis
If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as “probable,” “suspected,”
“likely,” “questionable,” “possible,” or “still to be ruled out,” “compatible with,” “consistent
with,” or other similar terms indicating uncertainty, code the condition as if it existed or was
established. The bases for these guidelines are the diagnostic workup, arrangements for further
workup or observation, and initial therapeutic approach that correspond most closely with the
established diagnosis.
Note: This guideline is applicable only to inpatient admissions to short-term, acute, long-term
care and psychiatric hospitals.
Section IV. Diagnostic Coding and Reporting Guidelines for
Outpatient Services
These coding guidelines for outpatient diagnoses have been approved for use by hospitals/ providers in
coding and reporting hospital-based outpatient services and provider-based office visits. Guidelines in
Section I, Conventions, general coding guidelines and chapter-specific guidelines, should also be applied
for outpatient services and office visits.
Information about the use of certain abbreviations, punctuation, symbols, and other conventions used in
the ICD-10-CM Tabular List (code numbers and titles), can be found in Section IA of these guidelines,
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 111 of 121

under “Conventions Used in the Tabular List.” Section I.B. contains general guidelines that apply to the
entire classification. Section I.C. contains chapter-specific guidelines that correspond to the chapters as
they are arranged in the classification. Information about the correct sequence to use in finding a code is
also described in Section I.
The terms encounter and visit are often used interchangeably in describing outpatient service contacts and,
therefore, appear together in these guidelines without distinguishing one from the other.
Though the conventions and general guidelines apply to all settings, coding guidelines for outpatient and
provider reporting of diagnoses will vary in a number of instances from those for inpatient diagnoses,
recognizing that:
The Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of principal diagnosis does not
apply to hospital-based outpatient services and provider-based office visits.
Coding guidelines for inconclusive diagnoses (probable, suspected, rule out, etc.) were developed
for inpatient reporting and do not apply to outpatients.
A. Selection of first-listed condition
In the outpatient setting, the term first-listed diagnosis is used in lieu of principal diagnosis.
In determining the first-listed diagnosis the coding conventions of ICD-10-CM, as well as the
general and disease specific guidelines take precedence over the outpatient guidelines.
Diagnoses often are not established at the time of the initial encounter/visit. It may take two or
more visits before the diagnosis is confirmed.
The most critical rule involves beginning the search for the correct code assignment through the
Alphabetic Index. Never begin searching initially in the Tabular List as this will lead to coding
errors.
1. Outpatient Surgery
When a patient presents for outpatient surgery (same day surgery), code the reason for
the surgery as the first-listed diagnosis (reason for the encounter), even if the surgery is
not performed due to a contraindication.
2. Observation Stay
When a patient is admitted for observation for a medical condition, assign a code for the
medical condition as the first-listed diagnosis.
When a patient presents for outpatient surgery and develops complications requiring
admission to observation, code the reason for the surgery as the first reported diagnosis
(reason for the encounter), followed by codes for the complications as secondary
diagnoses.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 112 of 121

B. Codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99, U00-U85
The appropriate code(s) from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99 and U00-U85 must be used to
identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems, complaints, or other reason(s) for the
encounter/visit.
C. Accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes
For accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, the documentation should describe the
patient’s condition, using terminology which includes specific diagnoses as well as symptoms,
problems, or reasons for the encounter. There are ICD-10-CM codes to describe all of these.
D. Codes that describe symptoms and signs
Codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnoses, are acceptable for reporting
purposes when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the provider. Chapter 18 of
ICD-10-CM, Symptoms, Signs, and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings Not Elsewhere
Classified (codes R00-R99) contain many, but not all codes for symptoms.
E. Encounters for circumstances other than a disease or injury
ICD-10-CM provides codes to deal with encounters for circumstances other than a disease or
injury. The Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services codes (Z00-
Z99) are provided to deal with occasions when circumstances other than a disease or injury are
recorded as diagnosis or problems.
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health services.
F. Level of Detail in Coding
1. ICD-10-CM codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters
ICD-10-CM is composed of codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters. Codes with three
characters are included in ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of codes that may be
further subdivided by the use of fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh characters to provide
greater specificity.
2. Use of full number of characters required for a code
A three-character code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. A code is invalid
if it has not been coded to the full number of characters required for that code, including
the 7th character, if applicable.
3. Highest level of specificity
Code to the highest level of specificity when supported by the medical record
documentation.
G. ICD-10-CM code for the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other
reason for encounter/visit
List first the ICD-10-CM code for the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for
encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for the services provided.
List additional codes that describe any coexisting conditions. In some cases, the first-listed
diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the
provider.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 113 of 121

H. Uncertain diagnosis
Do not code diagnoses documented as “probable”, “suspected,” “questionable,” “rule out,”
“compatible with,” “consistent with,” or “working diagnosis” or other similar terms indicating
uncertainty. Rather, code the condition(s) to the highest degree of certainty for that
encounter/visit, such as symptoms, signs, abnormal test results, or other reason for the visit.
Please note: This differs from the coding practices used by short-term, acute care, long-term
care and psychiatric hospitals.
I. Chronic diseases
Chronic diseases treated on an ongoing basis may be coded and reported as many times as the
patient receives treatment and care for the condition(s).
J. Code all documented conditions that coexist
Code all documented conditions that coexist at the time of the encounter/visit and that require
or affect patient care, treatment or management. Do not code conditions that were previously
treated and no longer exist. However, history codes (categories Z80-Z87) may be used as
secondary codes if the historical condition or family history has an impact on current care or
influences treatment.
K. Patients receiving diagnostic services only
For patients receiving diagnostic services only during an encounter/visit, sequence first the
diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for encounter/visit shown in the medical record
to be chiefly responsible for the outpatient services provided during the encounter/visit. Codes
for other diagnoses (e.g., chronic conditions) may be sequenced as additional diagnoses.
For encounters for routine laboratory/radiology testing in the absence of any signs, symptoms,
or associated diagnosis, assign Z01.89, Encounter for other specified special examinations. If
routine testing is performed during the same encounter as a test to evaluate a sign, symptom, or
diagnosis, it is appropriate to assign both the Z code and the code describing the reason for the
non-routine test.
For outpatient encounters for diagnostic tests that have been interpreted by a physician, and the
final report is available at the time of coding, code any confirmed or definitive diagnosis(es)
documented in the interpretation. Do not code related signs and symptoms as additional
diagnoses.
Please note: This differs from the coding practice in the hospital inpatient setting regarding
abnormal findings on test results.
L. Patients receiving therapeutic services only
For patients receiving therapeutic services only during an encounter/visit, sequence first the
diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for encounter/visit shown in the medical record
to be chiefly responsible for the outpatient services provided during the encounter/visit. Codes
for other diagnoses (e.g., chronic conditions) may be sequenced as additional diagnoses.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 114 of 121

The only exception to this rule is that when the primary reason for the admission/encounter is
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the appropriate Z code for the service is listed first, and the
diagnosis or problem for which the service is being performed listed second.
M. Patients receiving preoperative evaluations only
For patients receiving preoperative evaluations only, sequence first a code from subcategory
Z01.81, Encounter for pre-procedural examinations, to describe the pre-op consultations.
Assign a code for the condition to describe the reason for the surgery as an additional diagnosis.
Code also any findings related to the pre-op evaluation.
N. Ambulatory surgery
For ambulatory surgery, code the diagnosis for which the surgery was performed. If the
postoperative diagnosis is known to be different from the preoperative diagnosis at the time the
diagnosis is confirmed, select the postoperative diagnosis for coding, since it is the most
definitive.
O. Routine outpatient prenatal visits
See Section I.C.15. Routine outpatient prenatal visits.
P. Encounters for general medical examinations with abnormal findings
The subcategories for encounters for general medical examinations, Z00.0- and encounter for
routine child health examination, Z00.12-, provide codes for with and without abnormal
findings. Should a general medical examination result in an abnormal finding, the code for
general medical examination with abnormal finding should be assigned as the first-listed
diagnosis. An examination with abnormal findings refers to a condition/diagnosis that is newly
identified or a change in severity of a chronic condition (such as uncontrolled hypertension, or
an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) during a routine physical
examination. A secondary code for the abnormal finding should also be coded.
Q. Encounters for routine health screenings
See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health services,
Screening

Appendix I
Present on Admission Reporting Guidelines
Introduction
These guidelines are to be used as a supplement to the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for
Coding and Reporting to facilitate the assignment of the Present on Admission (POA) indicator
for each diagnosis and external cause of injury code reported on claim forms (UB-04 and 837
Institutional).
These guidelines are not intended to replace any guidelines in the main body of the ICD-10-CM
Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting. The POA guidelines are not intended to provide
guidance on when a condition should be coded, but rather, how to apply the POA indicator to the
final set of diagnosis codes that have been assigned in accordance with Sections I, II, and III of
the official coding guidelines. Subsequent to the assignment of the ICD-10-CM codes, the POA
indicator should then be assigned to those conditions that have been coded.
As stated in the Introduction to the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, a
joint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is essential to achieve complete and
accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of diagnoses and procedures. The
importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be
overemphasized. Medical record documentation from any provider involved in the care and
treatment of the patient may be used to support the determination of whether a condition was
present on admission or not. In the context of the official coding guidelines, the term “provider”
means a physician or any qualified healthcare practitioner who is legally accountable for
establishing the patient’s diagnosis.
These guidelines are not a substitute for the provider’s clinical judgment as to the determination
of whether a condition was/was not present on admission. The provider should be queried
regarding issues related to the linking of signs/symptoms, timing of test results, and the timing of
findings.
Please see the CDC website for the detailed list of ICD-10-CM codes that do not require the use
of a POA indicator (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd-10-cm/files.html). The codes and
categories on this exempt list are for circumstances regarding the healthcare encounter or factors
influencing health status that do not represent a current disease or injury or that describe
conditions that are always present on admission.
General Reporting Requirements
All claims involving inpatient admissions to general acute care hospitals or other
facilities that are subject to a law or regulation mandating collection of present on
admission information.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 116 of 121

Present on admission is defined as present at the time the order for inpatient admission
occurs -- conditions that develop during an outpatient encounter, including emergency
department, observation, or outpatient surgery, are considered as present on admission.
POA indicator is assigned to principal and secondary diagnoses (as defined in Section II
of the Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting) and the external cause of injury
codes.
Issues related to inconsistent, missing, conflicting or unclear documentation must still be
resolved by the provider.
If a condition would not be coded and reported based on UHDDS definitions and current
official coding guidelines, then the POA indicator would not be reported.
Reporting Options
Y – Yes
N – No
U – Unknown
W – Clinically undetermined
Unreported/Not used – (Exempt from POA reporting)
Reporting Definitions
Y = present at the time of inpatient admission
N = not present at the time of inpatient admission
U = documentation is insufficient to determine if condition is present on admission
W = provider is unable to clinically determine whether condition was present on
admission or not
Timeframe for POA Identification and Documentation
There is no required timeframe as to when a provider (per the definition of “provider”
used in these guidelines) must identify or document a condition to be present on
admission. In some clinical situations, it may not be possible for a provider to make a
definitive diagnosis (or a condition may not be recognized or reported by the patient) for
a period of time after admission. In some cases, it may be several days before the
provider arrives at a definitive diagnosis. This does not mean that the condition was not
present on admission. Determination of whether the condition was present on admission
or not will be based on the applicable POA guideline as identified in this document, or on
the provider’s best clinical judgment.
If at the time of code assignment the documentation is unclear as to whether a condition
was present on admission or not, it is appropriate to query the provider for clarification.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 117 of 121

Assigning the POA Indicator
Condition is on the “Exempt from Reporting” list
Leave the “present on admission” field blank if the condition is on the list of ICD-
10-CM codes for which this field is not applicable. This is the only circumstance
in which the field may be left blank.
POA Explicitly Documented
Assign Y for any condition the provider explicitly documents as being present on
admission.
Assign N for any condition the provider explicitly documents as not present at the
time of admission.
Conditions diagnosed prior to inpatient admission
Assign “Y” for conditions that were diagnosed prior to admission (example:
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma)
Conditions diagnosed during the admission but clearly present before admission
Assign “Y” for conditions diagnosed during the admission that were clearly
present but not diagnosed until after admission occurred.
Diagnoses subsequently confirmed after admission are considered present on
admission if at the time of admission they are documented as suspected, possible,
rule out, differential diagnosis, or constitute an underlying cause of a symptom
that is present at the time of admission.
Condition develops during outpatient encounter prior to inpatient admission
Assign Y for any condition that develops during an outpatient encounter prior to a
written order for inpatient admission.
Documentation does not indicate whether condition was present on admission
Assign “U” when the medical record documentation is unclear as to whether the
condition was present on admission. “U” should not be routinely assigned and
used only in very limited circumstances. Coders are encouraged to query the
providers when the documentation is unclear.
Documentation states that it cannot be determined whether the condition was or was not
present on admission
Assign “W” when the medical record documentation indicates that it cannot be
clinically determined whether or not the condition was present on admission.
Chronic condition with acute exacerbation during the admission
If a single code identifies both the chronic condition and the acute exacerbation,
see POA guidelines pertaining to codes that contain multiple clinical concepts.
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 118 of 121

If a single code only identifies the chronic condition and not the acute
exacerbation (e.g., acute exacerbation of chronic leukemia), assign “Y.”
Conditions documented as possible, probable, suspected, or rule out at the time of
discharge
If the final diagnosis contains a possible, probable, suspected, or rule out
diagnosis, and this diagnosis was based on signs, symptoms or clinical findings
suspected at the time of inpatient admission, assign “Y.”
If the final diagnosis contains a possible, probable, suspected, or rule out
diagnosis, and this diagnosis was based on signs, symptoms or clinical findings
that were not present on admission, assign “N”.
Conditions documented as impending or threatened at the time of discharge
If the final diagnosis contains an impending or threatened diagnosis, and this
diagnosis is based on symptoms or clinical findings that were present on
admission, assign “Y”.
If the final diagnosis contains an impending or threatened diagnosis, and this
diagnosis is based on symptoms or clinical findings that were not present on
admission, assign “N”.
Acute and Chronic Conditions
Assign “Y” for acute conditions that are present at time of admission and N for
acute conditions that are not present at time of admission.
Assign “Y” for chronic conditions, even though the condition may not be
diagnosed until after admission.
If a single code identifies both an acute and chronic condition, see the POA
guidelines for codes that contain multiple clinical concepts.
Codes That Contain Multiple Clinical Concepts
Assign “N” if at least one of the clinical concepts included in the code was not
present on admission (e.g., COPD with acute exacerbation and the exacerbation
was not present on admission; gastric ulcer that does not start bleeding until after
admission; asthma patient develops status asthmaticus after admission).
Assign “Y” if all of the clinical concepts included in the code were present on
admission (e.g., duodenal ulcer that perforates prior to admission).
For infection codes that include the causal organism, assign “Y” if the infection
(or signs of the infection) were present on admission, even though the culture
results may not be known until after admission (e.g., patient is admitted with
ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting
FY 2026
Page 119 of 121

pneumonia and the provider documents Pseudomonas as the causal organism a
few days later).
Same Diagnosis Code for Two or More Conditions
When the same ICD-10-CM diagnosis code applies to two or more conditions
during the same encounter (e.g., two separate conditions classified to the same
ICD-10-CM diagnosis code):
Assign “Y” if all conditions represented by the single ICD-10-CM code were
present on admission (e.g., bilateral unspecified age-related cataracts).
Assign “N” if any of the conditions represented by the single ICD-10-CM code
was not present on admission (e.g. traumatic secondary and recurrent hemorrhage
and seroma is assigned to a single code T79.2, but only one of the conditions was
present on admission).
Obstetrical conditions
Whether or not the patient delivers during the current hospitalization does not
affect assignment of the POA indicator. The determining factor for POA
assignment is whether the pregnancy complication or obstetrical condition
described by the code was present at the time of admission or not.
If the pregnancy complication or obstetrical condition was present on admission
(e.g., patient admitted in preterm labor), assign “Y”.
If the pregnancy complication or obstetrical condition was not present on
admission (e.g., 2nd degree laceration during delivery, postpartum hemorrhage
that occurred during current hospitalization, fetal distress develops after
admission), assign “N”.
If the obstetrical code includes more than one diagnosis and any of the diagnoses
identified by the code were not present on admission assign “N”.
(e.g., Category O11, Pre-existing hypertension with pre-eclampsia)
Perinatal conditions
Newborns are not considered to be admitted until after birth. Therefore, any
condition present at birth or that developed in utero is considered present at
admission and should be assigned “Y”. This includes conditions that occur during
delivery (e.g., injury during delivery, meconium aspiration, exposure to
streptococcus B in the vaginal canal).
Congenital conditions and anomalies
Assign “Y” for congenital conditions and anomalies except for categories Q00-
Q99, Congenital anomalies, which are on the exempt list. Congenital conditions
are always considered present on admission.

External cause of injury codes
Assign “Y” for any external cause code representing an external cause of
morbidity that occurred prior to inpatient admission (e.g., patient fell out of bed at
home, patient fell out of bed in emergency room prior to admission)
Assign “N” for any external cause code representing an external cause of
morbidity that occurred during inpatient hospitalization (e.g., patient fell out of
hospital bed during hospital stay, patient experienced an adverse reaction to a
medication administered after inpatient admission).
