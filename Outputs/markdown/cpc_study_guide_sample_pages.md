Clinical Examples Used in this Book
AAPC believes it is important in training and testing to reflect as accurate a coding setting as possible to students and examinees.
All examples and case studies used in our study guides, exams, and workbooks are actual, redacted office visits and procedure
notes donated by AAPC members. To preserve the real world quality of these notes for educational purposes, we have not re-written
or edited the notes to the stringent grammatical or stylistic standards found in the text of our products. Some minor changes have
been made for clarity or to correct spelling errors originally in the notes, but essentially they are as one would find them in a coding
setting.

Chapter 2 Medical Terminology and Anatomy Review
Due to Greek and Latin origins of medical terms, the conventions for changing from singular to plural endings are dictated by a
specific set of guidelines, as demonstrated in the table below.
Plural Endings:
Word Ending Plural Ending Singular Example Plural Example
a ae vertebra vertebrae
en ina lumen lumina
ex (ix, yx) ices index indices
is es prognosis prognoses
ma mata stigma stigmata
nx (anx, inx, ynx) nges phalanx phalanges
on a phenomenon phenomena
um a serum sera
us i thrombus thrombi
Using the word parts for translation, you will find the approximate meaning of the complete medical term.
EXAMPLE Anatomical Planes and Directions
The word “cardiomyopathy” can be broken down to find its
meaning:
cardi/o—heart
my/o—muscle
pathy—disease
Cardiomyopathy is a diseased heart muscle.
Anatomic Positions and Planes
The standard body position is considered the anatomic position.
The anatomic position is an upright, face-forward position
with the arms by the side and palms facing forward. The feet
are parallel and slightly apart. When you view an anatomical
picture, it is facing you in this manner.

D. I12.0, N18.5
4. The patient is a 69-year-old white female with 10-year status post dual chamber pacemaker where the generator is at its end
of life. The pacemaker generator is explanted, and the leads are then attached to the new generator. What is/are the CPT®
code(s) for this encounter?

5. A 38-year-old’s blood pressure was progressively trending downward, and it was determined that an emergent central
venous access was needed for fluid resuscitation. A non-tunneled catheter was used to access the subclavian vein and
secured into place to infuse medication. Due to the patient’s low blood pressure and anticipated need for vasopressor agents,
a radial arterial line was also desired. The left radial artery pulse was easily palpable, and the skin was punctured by a
needle, and the angiocatheter was placed in the left wrist. What are the CPT® codes for this encounter?

6. Mrs. Doelle goes to the procedure room to have a permanent pacemaker implanted. She is given a mild sedative, and the
area just under the right clavicle is prepped and draped in a sterile manor. An incision is made to create a pocket for the
pulse generator. A venogram is shot through an indwelling antecubital IV, and a catheter is threaded from the pocket
into the right subclavian vein. The catheter is then advanced into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. Using the
Seldinger technique the catheter is withdrawn over a guide wire, and a 32 FR Medtronic pacing wire is threaded back over
the guide wire and into the right atrium under fluoroscopy. The guide wire is removed, and the pacing tip is screwed into the
myocardium. Thresholds are tested for sensing and capture. The lead is then attached to the pulse generator and placed into
the pocket. The pocket is closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene. What is/are the CPT® code(s) for this encounter?
A. 93288-26, 33249

D. 33206, 33212-51
7. Using Xylocaine local anesthesia, aseptic technique, and ultrasound guidance for vascular access, a 21-gauge needle
was used to aspirate the right cephalic vein of a 72-year-old patient. When blood was obtained, a 0.018 inch platinum tip
guidewire was advanced to the central venous circulation. A 6 French dual lumen PICC was introduced through a 6 French
peel-away sheath to the superior vena cava and right atrium junction, and after removal of the sheath, the catheter was
attached to the skin with a STAT-LOCK device and flushed with 500 units of Heparin in each lumen. A sterile dressing was
applied, and the patient was discharged in improved condition. Permanent ultrasound recordings were placed in the record.
What is/are the CPT® code(s) for this encounter?
A. 36573, 76942-26
B. 36556, 76942-26

8. After obtaining an aortogram and CT scan, a 45-year-old woman was found to have an infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm measuring at least 4.5 cm in size that has not ruptured. It was felt that with the rapid recent expansion, she should
have this aneurysm repaired. The infrarenal artery aneurysm was repaired at the level of the renal arteries to the aortic
bifurcation. What is the CPT® code for this procedure?
A. 34702
B. 34701
C. 34706
D. 34707
9. Operative Report #1
Preoperative Diagnosis: Sick sinus syndrome with bradycardia/tachycardia
Postoperative Diagnosis: Permanent DDDR pacemaker insertion
Operation Performed: Pacemaker insertion
Anesthesia: Local with conscious sedation
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: Minimal
Adjunctive Procedures: Fluoroscopy
Description of Procedure: Following informed consent, the left subclavian artery was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile manner. Following local, administration of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the left subclavian vein was entered with
an 18-gauge, thin-wall needle. J-wire was placed. Transverse incision was created and dissected at the pectoral fascia. A

Answers and Rationales
Appendix
for Chapter Review Questions
A
Chapter 1
1. D. Part D
RATIONALE: Medicare Part D is for prescription drug coverage. The patient’s prescription for the pain medication would be
billed to Medicare Part D.
2. B. Translating medical documentation into codes
RATIONALE: Coding is the process of translating written or dictated medical records into numeric or alpha-numeric codes.
3. B. Workers’ compensation
RATIONALE: A covered entity of HIPPA
l A healthcare provider, such as:
l Doctors
l Clinics
l Psychologists
l Nursing Homes
l Pharmacies
l A health plan, to include:
l Health Insurance Companies
l HMOs
l Company Health Plans
l Government programs that pay for healthcare, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the military and veterans’
healthcare programs
l A healthcare clearinghouse
4. C. Blue Cross Blue Shield
RATIONALE: There are two primary types of insurers: commercial and government. Commercial payers are private payers
that offer both group and individual plans. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations are private payers who usually
operate in the state in which they are based.
5. B. When a service is not expected to be covered by Medicare
RATIONALE: The Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) is a standardized form that explains to the patient why Medicare may
deny the service or procedure. The ABN form should be completed for services potentially non-covered by Medicare to advise
the patient of potential financial responsibility.
6. B. $100 or 25% of cost
RATIONALE: CMS instructions stipulate, “Notifiers must make a good faith effort to insert a reasonable estimate…the
estimate should be within $100 or 25 percent of the actual costs, whichever is greater.”
7. C. Clearinghouse
RATIONALE: A Healthcare Clearinghouse is an entity that processes nonstandard health information they receive from
another entity into a standard (such as standard electronic format, or data content), or vice versa.
