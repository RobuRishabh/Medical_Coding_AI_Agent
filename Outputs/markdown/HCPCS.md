Introduction
•For Medicare and other health insurance programs to ensure
that healthcare claims are processed in an orderly and
consistent manner, standardized coding systems are essential.
The HCPCS Level II Code Set is one of the standard code sets
used for this purpose.
•The HCPCS is divided into two principal subsystems, referred to
as level I and level II of the HCPCS.
•Level I of the HCPCS is comprised of CPT (Current Procedural
Terminology), a numeric coding system created and maintained
by the American Medical Association (AMA).
3
3
Introduction
•The CPT is a uniform coding system consisting of descriptive terms
and identifying codes that are used primarily to identify medical
services and procedures furnished by physicians and other health
care professionals.
•These health care professionals use the CPT to identify services and
procedures for which they bill public or private health insurance
programs.
•Decisions regarding the addition, deletion, or revision of CPT codes
are made by the AMA. The CPT codes are republished and updated
annually by the AMA.

Introduction
•Level I of the HCPCS, the CPT codes, does not include codes
needed to separately report medical items or services that are
regularly billed by suppliers other than physicians.
•Level II of the HCPCS is a standardized coding system that is used
primarily to identify products, supplies, and services not included in
the CPT codes, such as ambulance services and durable medical
equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) when
used outside a physician's office.
•Because Medicare and other insurers cover a variety of services,
supplies, and equipment that are not identified by CPT codes, the
level II HCPCS codes were established for submitting claims for
these items.
5
5
Introduction
• The development and use of level II of the HCPCS began in the 1980’s.
• Level II codes are also referred to as alpha-numeric codes because they
consist of a single alphabetical letter followed by 4 numeric digits, while
CPT codes are identified using 5 numeric digits.
• Level II HCPCS codes are released by Medicare on an annual basis with
quarterly updates as necessary.
• Data files and pertinent related information is found at the CMS.GOV
website which can include files in Excel, Microsoft Word, and Portable
Document Files (PDF).
• CMS holds public meetings as forums to discuss code development,
change, deletion, and payment criteria. Application for code set updates
are now held twice a year in January and June.

•CMS holds public meetings as forums to discuss code development,

•Dental codes, or D codes, are a separate category of national codes.
•The Current Dental Terminology (CDT) is published, copyrighted,
and licensed by the American Dental Association (ADA).

Introduction
•The CDT lists codes for billing for dental procedures and supplies.
•While the CDT codes are considered HCPCS Level II codes,
decisions regarding the revision, deletion, or addition of CDT codes
are made by the ADA, not CMS.

Modifiers Update
•“AB” - Audiology service furnished personally by an audiologist
without a physician/NPP order for non-acute hearing assessment
unrelated to disequilibrium, or hearing aids, or examinations for the
purpose of prescribing, fitting, or changing hearing aids; service may
be performed once every 12 months, per beneficiary
•CMS finalized a policy to allow beneficiaries direct access to an
audiologist without an order from a physician or NPP for non-acute
hearing conditions. The finalized policy will use a new modifier ─
instead of using a new HCPCS G-code that they proposed ─ because
they were persuaded by the commenters that a modifier would allow for
better accuracy of reporting and reduce burden for audiologist.
10

12/5/2022
Modifiers Update
•The service(s) can be billed using the codes audiologists already use
with the new modifier and include only those personally furnished by the
audiologist.
•The finalized direct access policy will allow beneficiaries to receive care
for non-acute hearing assessments that are unrelated to disequilibrium,
hearing aids, or examinations for the purpose of prescribing, fitting, or
changing hearing aids.
•This modification in the finalized policy necessitates multiple changes to
the claims processing systems, which will take some time to fully
operationalize, but audiologists may use modifier AB, along with the
finalized list of 36 CPT codes, for dates of service on and after January
1, 2023.
11
11
Modifiers Update
•CMS finalized the proposal to permit audiologists to bill for this direct
access (without a physician or practitioner order) once every 12 months
per beneficiary.
•Medically reasonable and necessary tests ordered by a physician or
other practitioner and personally provided by audiologists will not be
affected by the direct access policy, including the modifier and frequency
limitation.

12/5/2022
Modifiers Update
• “LU” - Fractionated Payment Of Car-T Therapy
•To avoid the character/digit limitation, the physician office would bill
multiple claims for fractional units for the same date of service and the
same procedure using the LU modifier. Each Medicare Administrative
Contractor will issue instructions for the appropriate jurisdiction(s) to
properly utilize this modifier when submitting claims.
•For instance, a Medicare Administrative Contractor may instruct the
claimant to divide the Medicare allowed total payment by 10 and the
provider will need to bill in 0.1 unit fractions. The provider would then
need to bill a total of 10 fractional units to reach the total Medicare
allowed payment amount of 1-unit. To avoid duplicate claim denials,
Medicare Administrative Contractors may also provide instructions on
the use of modifier 76 for the additional claims after the first claim.
13
13
Modifiers Update
• “LU” - Fractionated Payment Of Car-T Therapy
•CMS is not aware of any claims affected by hospitals billing under the
Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) or
Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS); thus, this
modifier is not intended for claims submission for OPPS or IPPS.
•Other payers may or may not elect to utilize this modifier for a similar
purpose. Please consult with the individual payer for instructions.
• This modifier is retroactively effective for dates of service on or after January 1,
2022.

12/5/2022
Modifiers Update
•“JZ” - Zero Drug Amount Discarded/Not Administered To Any Patient
• Federal law requires drug manufacturers to refund CMS for certain discarded
amounts from refundable single-dose containers or single-use package drugs
(Medicare Part B). CMS will have to report any discarded medication recorded
above a 10 percent low-volume threshold. Certain drugs will be excluded – like
imaging agents or drugs new (less than 18 months) to Medicare Part B
reimbursement.
• CMS is finalized in the 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) Final
Rule that starting next year, a separate JZ modifier be used to denote NO
discarded amounts.
• Practices will continue to use the JW modifier indicating waste as well as the
JZ modifier indicating no waste. In preparation for this new JZ modifier
practices should review workflow, automation and how data enters its MAR
and EMR.

Future Updates
• The 2023 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), Outpatient
Prospective Payment System (OPPS), and Medicare Physician Fee
Schedules (MPFS) still have forthcoming updates which may impact the
HCPCS Level I (CPT-4) and HCPCS Level II (Alpha-Numeric) code sets.
• There are placeholder codes in these rules which will not be updated until
all documents have been reviewed and posted on the Federal Register
website.
• Placeholder info can be viewed in the Q3 HCPCS Summary -
https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2022-hcpcs-application-summary-quarter-
3-2022-drugs-and-biologicals-updated-11042022.pdf
• Any present data files from CMS for the code set as of 11/8/2022 will be
amended and updated after Thanksgiving and possibly up until December
31st, 2022.
