Evaluation and Management Services
99217 Observation care discharge day management (This code is to be utilized to report all services
provided to a patient on discharge from outpatient hospital “observation status” if the discharge
is on other than the initial date of “observation status.” To report services to a patient designated
as “observation status” or “inpatient status” and discharged on the same date, use the codes for
Observation or Inpatient Care Services [including Admission and Discharge Services, 99234-99236 as
appropriate.])
AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes 99217, which represented services provided to a patient being discharged from
observation status on a date other than the observation start date. In place of 99217, you should use
revised hospital inpatient or observation discharge codes 99238 (30 minutes or less) and 99239 (more
than 30 minutes). The deletion of 99217 is part of a major revision to the evaluation and management
(E/M) section of CPT®.
Effective date of this deletion: January 1, 2023.
99218 Initial observation care, per day, for the evaluation and management of a patient which requires
these 3 key components:
l A detailed or comprehensive history;
l A detailed or comprehensive examination; and
l Medical decision making that is straightforward or of low complexity.
Counseling and/or coordination of care with other physicians, other qualified health care
professionals, or agencies are provided consistent with the nature of the problem(s) and the patient’s
and/or family’s needs.
Usually, the problem(s) requiring admission to outpatient hospital “observation status” are of low
severity. Typically, 30 minutes are spent at the bedside and on the patient’s hospital floor or unit.
AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes 99218, 99219, and 99220, which represented initial observation care to a patient. In place
of 99218-99220, you should use revised initial hospital inpatient or observation care codes 99221 (low
medical decision making [MDM] or at least 40 minutes total time), 99222 (moderate MDM or at least 55
minutes total time), and 99223 (high MDM or at least 75 minutes total time). The deletion of 99218-
99220 is part of a major revision to the evaluation and management (E/M) section of CPT®.
Effective date of this deletion: January 1, 2023.

l Medical decision making of moderate complexity.
Counseling and/or coordination of care with other physicians, other qualified health care
professionals, or agencies are provided consistent with the nature of the problem(s) and the patient’s
and/or family’s needs.
Usually, the problem(s) requiring admission to outpatient hospital “observation status” are of
moderate severity. Typically, 50 minutes are spent at the bedside and on the patient’s hospital floor or
unit.
AAPC Rationale

99220 is part of a major revision to the evaluation and management (E/M) section of CPT®.
Effective date of this deletion: January 1, 2023.
99220 Initial observation care, per day, for the evaluation and management of a patient, which requires
these 3 key components:
l A comprehensive history;
l A comprehensive examination; and
l Medical decision making of high complexity.
Counseling and/or coordination of care with other physicians, other qualified health care
professionals, or agencies are provided consistent with the nature of the problem(s) and the patient’s
and/or family’s needs.
Usually, the problem(s) requiring admission to outpatient hospital “observation status” are of high
severity. Typically, 70 minutes are spent at the bedside and on the patient’s hospital floor or unit.
AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes 99218, 99219, and 99220, which represented initial observation care to a patient. In place

of the code set. Codes 99304-99306 previously represented initial nursing facility care requiring
specific levels of the three key components (history, exam, and medical decision making [MDM]).
The descriptors also stated a usual severity level and a typical amount of time. The revised codes
now include a medically appropriate history, exam, or both, but those elements are not involved in
selecting the E/M level. You will select the appropriate code based on MDM or total time on the date of
the encounter. Code 99304 requires straightforward or low MDM or at least 25 minutes of total time.

descriptors remove the term “day” and clarify that the total time is on the encounter date. Guidelines
with the codes state you should base code selection on “total time on the date of the discharge
management face-to-face encounter,” even when that encounter occurs before the date the patient
leaves the facility. Code 99315 continues to apply when the service is 30 minutes or less, and 99316

CPT® revises 99341, 99342, 99344, and 99345 as part of a major revision to the evaluation and
management (E/M) section of the code set. The code set also deletes 99343. The descriptors for 99341-
99345 previously referred to a home visit for a new patient requiring specific levels of three key
components (history, exam, and medical decision making [MDM]). The descriptors also stated a usual
severity level and a typical amount of time. The revised code descriptors refer to “home or residence
visit.” The codes now include a medically appropriate history, exam, or both, but those elements are
not involved in selecting the E/M level. You will select the appropriate code based on MDM or total
time on the date of the encounter. Code 99341 requires straightforward MDM or at least 15 minutes of

Evaluation and Management services)
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises prolonged outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) code +99417 as part of a major
revision to the E/M section. Previously, the only appropriate primary codes for +99417 were office
and other outpatient E/M codes 99205 and 99215. Now, appropriate primary codes include 99205
and 99215, office or other outpatient consult code 99245, home or residence visit codes 99345 and
99350, and care planning for a patient with cognitive impairment code 99483. CPT® deletes outpatient
prolonged services codes +99354 and +99355. As before, the CPT® rule for reporting +99417 is that it is
appropriate only when you select the primary service code based on time, and you may report +99417
once the service has exceeded the time required to report the primary service by 15 minutes. For
instance, office E/M code 99205 represents 60-74 minutes of total time. You may report +99417 once
the service reaches 75 minutes of total time, which is the minimum of 60 minutes plus 15 minutes.
Note that payers may have different codes and rules for reporting prolonged services.

the inpatient and observation Evaluation and Management service)
AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds prolonged inpatient and observation evaluation and management (E/M) code +99418 as
part of a major revision to the E/M section. Appropriate primary codes include hospital inpatient
or observation care codes 99223, 99233, and 99236; inpatient or observation consult code 99255;
and nursing facility care codes 99306 and 99310. CPT® deletes inpatient and observation prolonged
services codes +99356 and +99357. The CPT® rule for reporting +99418 is that it is appropriate
only when you select the primary service code based on time, and you may report +99418 once the
service has exceeded the time required to report the primary service by 15 minutes. For instance, the
descriptor for inpatient or observation care code 99223 states “75 minutes must be met or exceeded.”
You may report +99418 once the service reaches 90 minutes of total time, which is 75 minutes plus 15
minutes.

AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 15778 for implanting absorbable mesh or another prosthesis to assist with delayed closure
of one or more defects in the external genitalia, perineum (area between the anus and the scrotum or
vulva), and/or abdominal wall. The soft tissue defect may be the result of infection or trauma.

15850 Removal of sutures under anesthesia (other than local), same surgeon
AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes 15850, which represented suture removal under anesthesia by the same surgeon. The
code did not apply to the use of local anesthesia. Related to this update, CPT® revises 15851. In 2022,
15851 applied to suture removal under nonlocal anesthesia by a different surgeon. In 2023, the code
applies to removal of either sutures or staples, requiring general anesthesia or moderate sedation.
The code set also adds +15853 for suture or staple removal not requiring anesthesia and +15854
for removal of both sutures and staples not requiring anesthesia. You’ll use +15853 and +15854 in
addition to evaluation and management (E/M) codes.

▲ 22857 Total disc arthroplasty (artificial disc), anterior approach, including discectomy to prepare interspace
(other than for decompression),; single interspace, lumbar
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises total disc arthroplasty code 22857, which represents restoring spine joint function by
placing an artificial disc. CPT® changes the comma before the phrase “single interspace, lumbar” to
a semicolon. This small change allows 22857 to share the first part of its descriptor with new code
+22860, which you’ll use for the “second interspace, lumbar.” These changes are related to the deletion
of +0163T. The descriptor for +22860 is almost identical to +0163T, except new code +22860 specifies
“second interspace” while deleted code +0163T used the phrase “each additional interspace.” This
difference is important because CPT® now instructs you to use 22899 for more than two interspaces.
Effective date of this revision: January 1, 2023.
▲ 22630 Arthrodesis, posterior interbody technique, including laminectomy and/or discectomy to prepare
interspace (other than for decompression), single interspace,; lumbar
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises 22630 and +22632 as part of a larger revision to arthrodesis (joint fusion) and
decompression codes. The descriptors for these two spinal arthrodesis codes share the portion of their
descriptors before the semicolon. In the revision, the semicolon moves from before “lumbar” to after to
clarify that +22632 is also specific to lumbar services. Report these codes per interspace. CPT® defines
a vertebral interspace, in part, as “the non-bony compartment between two adjacent vertebral bodies.”
Effective date of this revision: January 1, 2022.

▲ 22633 Arthrodesis, combined posterior or posterolateral technique with posterior interbody technique
including laminectomy and/or discectomy sufficient to prepare interspace (other than for
decompression), single interspace;, lumbar
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises 22633 and +22634 as part of a larger revision to arthrodesis (joint fusion) and
decompression codes. CPT® revises spinal arthrodesis codes 22600-+22614, 22633, and +22634 to
use the term interspace, rather than level or segment. CPT® defines a vertebral interspace, in part,
as “the non-bony compartment between two adjacent vertebral bodies.” Specifically, 22633 changes
from “single interspace and segment; lumbar” to “single interspace, lumbar;” — which also includes
moving the semicolon to be after “lumbar.” The descriptors for arthrodesis codes 22633 and +22634
share the portion of their descriptors before the semicolon, so the revision clarifies that +22634 is also
specific to lumbar services. The descriptor for +22634 also removes the phrase “and segment” so that
the descriptor now specifies “each additional interspace.” Note that the semicolon change for both
codes and deletion of “and segment” from +22634 were announced in the CPT® Errata and Technical
Corrections document.

AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises sacroiliac (SI) joint arthrodesis code 27280 with minor editorial changes, such as
rearranging word order for clarification. Code 27280 is for an open approach. Do not confuse 27280
with new code 0775T for percutaneous placement of implants in the sacroiliac (SI) joint for arthrodesis
or with existing percutaneous/minimally invasive code 27279, which represents transfixing the SI
joint by passing devices through the ilium of the pelvis, across the SI joint, and into the sacrum at the
base of the spine.

AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 30469 for nasal valve repair using radiofrequency energy. The energy, applied using a small
wand placed in the nostrils, reshapes the tissues inside the nose to improve the patient’s breathing. An
instructional note with the code indicates 30469 is a bilateral procedure.

connections, unilateral
AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 33900-+33904 for pulmonary artery stenting using a percutaneous (minimally invasive
through the skin) approach. Codes 33900 (unilateral) and 33901 (bilateral) apply to stent placement
via normal native connections. Codes 33902 (unilateral) and 33903 (bilateral) apply to stent placement
via abnormal connections or through postsurgical shunts. You’ll report add-on code +33904 for each
additional vessel or separate lesion beyond the primary vessel or lesion, whether using normal or
abnormal connections. These codes include necessary services for a percutaneous procedure, such as
vascular access, catheter manipulation, fluoroscopy, angiography for roadmapping and postimplant
evaluation, and angioplasty within the same lesion as the stent implant.

CPT® revises 35883 by making a small editorial change. The code describes open revision of a
femoral anastomosis of a synthetic arterial bypass graft. The update changes the list of examples
of nonautogenous patch grafts by replacing the trade name Dacron® with the more generic term
polyester. Nonautogenous means the graft is not made from the patient’s own tissue.

AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 36836 and 36837 for percutaneous creation of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula in the
upper extremity. An AV fistula is a surgically created connection between an artery and vein for
hemodialysis. Use 36836 when the provider uses a single access site and 36837 when the provider
uses two access sites for the peripheral artery and peripheral vein. These codes include services
necessary for the percutaneous procedure, such as vascular access and imaging guidance. The codes
also include, but don’t require, maturation procedures, like balloon angioplasty, that encourage blood
to flow through the fistula.

CPT® deletes 49560 and 49561 for initial repair of an incisional or ventral hernia. This change is
part of a major update to hernia repair coding. Instead of 49560 (for reducible hernia) and 49561 (for
incarcerated or strangulated hernia), you’ll choose from new codes 49591-49596. The new codes apply
to initial anterior abdominal hernia repair (epigastric, incisional, ventral, umbilical, or spigelian)
using any approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic). Codes 49591, 49593, and 49595 are specific to
reducible hernias. Codes 49592, 49594, and 49596 are for incarcerated or strangulated hernias. You

incisional or ventral hernia repair)
AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes mesh or other prosthesis implantation code +49568, which was an add-on code reported
in conjunction with incisional or ventral hernia repair. This change is part of a major update to hernia
repair coding. New anterior abdominal hernia repair codes 49591-49596 and 49613-49618 include, but
do not require, mesh or other prosthesis implantation. Because the new hernia repair codes include
implantation, when performed, you should no longer report that implantation service separately.

49570 Repair epigastric hernia (eg, preperitoneal fat); reducible (separate procedure)
AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes 49570 and 49572 for repair of an epigastric hernia. This change is part of a major
update to hernia repair coding. Instead of 49570 (for reducible hernia) and 49572 (for incarcerated
or strangulated hernia), you’ll choose from new codes 49591-49596 and 49613-49618. The new codes
apply to anterior abdominal hernia repair (epigastric, incisional, ventral, umbilical, or spigelian) using
any approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic). Codes 49591-49596 are specific to initial hernia repair.
Codes 49613-49618 are for recurrent hernia repair. You choose among the codes based on whether the
hernia is reducible or incarcerated/strangulated, and the distance between the outer margins of all
defects repaired. When the provider repairs both reducible and incarcerated or strangulated hernias
at the same session, report a repair code that specifies “incarcerated or strangulated.”

AAPC Rationale
CPT® deletes ventral, umbilical, spigelian, or epigastric hernia repair codes 49652 (for reducible
hernia) and 49653 (for incarcerated or strangulated hernia). The codes were specific to a laparoscopic
approach. This change is part of a major update to hernia repair coding. Instead of these codes, you’ll
choose from new codes 49591-49596 and 49613-49618. The new codes apply to anterior abdominal
hernia repair (epigastric, incisional, ventral, umbilical, or spigelian) using any approach (open,
laparoscopic, or robotic). Codes 49591-49596 are specific to initial hernia repair. Codes 49613-49618
are for recurrent hernia repair. You choose among the codes based on whether the hernia is reducible
or incarcerated/strangulated, and the distance between the outer margins of all defects repaired.
When the provider repairs both reducible and incarcerated or strangulated hernias at the same
session, report a repair code that specifies “incarcerated or strangulated.”

antegrade stent placement and nephrostomy tube placement, when performed, including imaging
guidance; simple (eg, stone[s] up to 2 cm in single location of kidney or renal pelvis, nonbranching
stones)
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises nephrolithotomy (stone removal from kidney) and pyelolithotomy (stone removal from
renal pelvis) codes 50080 and 50081. The codes share the first part of their descriptors. The first
revision is a terminology change from “Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy or pyelostolithotomy” to
“Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or pyelolithotomy.” The new descriptors remove the phrase “with
or without dilation.” Guidelines with the updated codes state percutaneous access creation or tract
dilation “to accommodate large endoscopic instruments used in stone removals (50436, 50437)
is not included in 50080, 50081, and may be reported separately, if performed.” In place of the
old descriptors’ “endoscopy, lithotripsy, stenting, or basket extraction,” the new descriptors state
“lithotripsy, stone extraction, antegrade ureteroscopy, antegrade stent placement and nephrostomy
tube placement, when performed.” The phrasing helps clarify the antegrade (“downhill”) nature of
the service and that nephrostomy tube placement is included. The new codes also include imaging
guidance, when performed, so you should not report that guidance using a separate code. Code
50080 previously specified “up to 2 cm,” and the previous 50081 descriptor specified “over 2 cm.”
The updated code descriptors will allow you to differentiate between simple (50080) and complex
(50081) procedures based on factors such as stone size, number of locations, whether the stones are
branching, and whether ureters or complicated anatomy are involved.

AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises 69716 as part of a larger update to codes for services related to osseointegrated (bone-
anchored) skull implants that treat hearing loss when coupled to a speech processor and vibratory
element. The coupling may be percutaneous (skin is penetrated) or transcutaneous (skin remains
intact).
For the codes that apply to percutaneous attachment, implant removal and replacement code 69717
deletes the phrase “Revision or” from the descriptor, and removal code 69726 clarifies that it applies
to “entire” removal of the implant. For removing only the abutment that protrudes through the skin,
you’ll use an evaluation and management (E/M) code.
For the codes that apply to magnetic transcutaneous attachment, the update revises implantation
code 69716 to specify that it applies to implantation when the service is within the mastoid (bone
just behind the ear) and/or results in removal of under 100 sq mm surface area of bone. Removal and
replacement code 69719 deletes “Revision or” from the descriptor, and it adds that the code applies
when the service is within the mastoid and/or involves a bony defect of under 100 sq mm. Similarly,
removal code 69727 adds “entire” to describe removal, and it adds that the code is appropriate when
the implant is in the mastoid and/or involves a bony defect under 100 sq mm. When the implant
with magnetic transcutaneous coupling is outside the mastoid and involves a bony defect with a

# ▲ 69726 Removal, entire osseointegrated implant, skull; with percutaneous attachment to external speech
processor
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises 69726 as part of a larger update to codes for services related to osseointegrated (bone-
anchored) skull implants that treat hearing loss when coupled to a speech processor and vibratory
element. The coupling may be percutaneous (skin is penetrated) or transcutaneous (skin remains
intact).
For the codes that apply to percutaneous attachment, implant removal and replacement code 69717
deletes the phrase “Revision or” from the descriptor, and removal code 69726 clarifies that it applies
to “entire” removal of the implant. For removing only the abutment that protrudes through the skin,
you’ll use an evaluation and management (E/M) code.
For the codes that apply to magnetic transcutaneous attachment, the update revises implantation
code 69716 to specify that it applies to implantation when the service is within the mastoid (bone
just behind the ear) and/or results in removal of under 100 sq mm surface area of bone. Removal and
replacement code 69719 deletes “Revision or” from the descriptor, and it adds that the code applies
when the service is within the mastoid and/or involves a bony defect of under 100 sq mm. Similarly,
removal code 69727 adds “entire” to describe removal, and it adds that the code is appropriate when
the implant is in the mastoid and/or involves a bony defect under 100 sq mm. When the implant
with magnetic transcutaneous coupling is outside the mastoid and involves a bony defect with a
surface area of 100 sq mm or more, you’ll use new codes 69729 (implantation), 69730 (removal and
replacement), and 69728 (removal).

speech processor, outside the mastoid and involving a bony defect greater than or equal to 100 sq mm
surface area of bone deep to the outer cranial cortex
AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 69728 as part of a larger update to codes for services related to osseointegrated (bone-
anchored) skull implants that treat hearing loss when coupled to a speech processor and vibratory
element. The coupling may be percutaneous (skin is penetrated) or transcutaneous (skin remains

space, peri-articular tendon[s], muscle[s], nerve[s], other soft-tissue structure[s], or soft-tissue
mass[es]), real-time with image documentation
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises limited ultrasound code 76882 by changing “joint or other nonvascular extremity
structure(s)” to “joint or focal evaluation of other nonvascular extremity structure(s).” This
change helps emphasize the limited nature of the ultrasound service. CPT® also adds 76883 for
comprehensive ultrasound of one or more nerves and the accompanying structures through their
entire anatomic course in one extremity.
Effective date of this revision: January 1, 2023.
● 76883 Ultrasound, nerve(s) and accompanying structures throughout their entire anatomic course in one
extremity, comprehensive, including real-time cine imaging with image documentation, per extremity
AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 76883 for comprehensive ultrasound of one or more nerves and the accompanying
structures through their entire anatomic course in one extremity. The service includes real-time
cine (movie) imaging and image documentation. CPT® also revises limited ultrasound code 76882
by changing “joint or other nonvascular extremity structure(s)” to “joint or focal evaluation of other
nonvascular extremity structure(s).” This change helps emphasize the limited nature of the ultrasound
service, which applies to focal evaluation of structures such as one or more nerves, tendons, muscles,
other soft tissue structures, or soft tissue masses.

radiopharmaceutical agent(s) (includes vascular flow and blood pool imaging, when performed);
tomographic (SPECT), single area (eg, head, neck, chest, pelvis) or acquisition, single day imaging
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises radiopharmaceutical localization SPECT codes 78803 and 78830-78832 to differentiate
reporting separate acquisitions. Instead of applying to just a single area on a single day, 78803 (SPECT)
and 78830 (SPECT-CT) now apply to a single area or acquisition on a single day. Codes 78831 (SPECT)
and 78832 (SPECT-CT) previously applied to a minimum of two areas in a single day or a single area
over two or more days. the codes now additionally apply to at least two separate acquisitions (such
as lung ventilation and perfusion) on a single day or a single acquisition over two or more days. The
update also changes one of the examples in 78831 and 78832. The “2 areas” example “abdomen and
pelvis” changed to “chest and abdomen.” This change offers areas distinct from the other example of
“pelvis and knees.”

AAPC Rationale
CPT® adds 90678 to report supply of a vaccine product that protects against respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus that can be serious, especially for infants and older adults.
The vaccine is bivalent, meaning the vaccine protects against two strains of the virus. The vaccine is
composed of two prefusion F (preF) proteins to improve protection against RSV A and B strains. PreF
is a form of the viral fusion protein (F) that RSV uses to enter human cells. Antibodies specific to preF
may block virus infection. The provider performs separately reportable intramuscular administration.
Effective date of this code: January 1, 2023.
▲ 90739 Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), CpG-adjuvanted, adult dosage, 2 dose or 4 dose schedule, for intramuscular
use
AAPC Rationale
CPT® revises 90739 to state that the hepatitis B vaccine product is CpG-adjuvanted, meaning CpG (a
synthetic form of DNA) has been added to the vaccine to increase the body’s immune response. Also,
the revision adds that the product may have a two-dose or four-dose schedule. Previously the code
descriptor referred only to a two-dose schedule.

Plan
Pulmonology and hematology and cardiology notes all reviewed. I spoke with Dr. Patel who was under the
impression that the sister had elected to have the patient be on comfort measures only and not pursue a
Greenfield filter or other intervention and she falls out her bed frequently. The lab results were reviewed with

Case 1
Dr. Patel and no changes. I see that the hospice nurse is evaluating the patient and I have a call out to her and
I left a message for her sister to call me. I would like to discuss whether to stop the heparin drip and whether
to send her out on Lovenox or just strictly comfort measures only in which case we would consider whether
she would be appropriate for inpatient hospice or back to her personal care home or other. Will continue the
drip for now. At this time, she is stable.

A 60-year-old male, who is status post-hernia repair of a 3- to 10-cm defect, undergoes removal of
sutures and staples during a separately reportable office or other outpatient evaluation and
management service.
Clean the area surrounding the wound(s) with normal saline or soak if crusting inhibits access to
sutures/staples. Remove the sutures and staples. Observe the
wound line(s) for separation during the procedure. Obtain hemostasis with pressure as needed. Apply
adhesive strips and sterile dressings as needed.

Case 3
OPERATIVE REPORT
ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Incarcerated ventral hernia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Incarcerated ventral hernia.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Incarcerated ventral hernia repair.
OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Upon entering the abdomen through the upper midline location over the
incarcerated hernia, an incarcerated hernia approximately 5-cm in diameter was identified. The hernia
was reduced into the abdominal cavity and the fascial defect was identified which measured
approximately 2-cm in size. A medium Ventrilex mesh was placed into the defect and sewn in place.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After undergoing adequate general endotracheal anesthesia and after
DuraPrep prepping the abdomen and draping with cloth towels and drapes, a midline incision was made
after injecting 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine. The dissection was continued over to the incarcerated
hernia, which was to the right of the midline, and the hernia sac was scored at its base and was
eventually reduced into the abdominal cavity. The underlying fascia was dissected free of its
surrounding tissue. The medium Ventrilex mesh was placed in the subfascial location and the straps
were cut. The mesh was sewn in place with #0 Ethibond suture. The wound was irrigated with normal
saline. 0.25% Marcaine was also utilized on the subcutaneous tissue and fascia to complete the
anesthetic with approximately 45 cc total of local anesthetic. The dermal edges were approximated
with a running #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges were approximated with a running subcuticular #4-0 Vicryl
and were further sealed with Dermabond.
The patient tolerated the procedure very well. Needle and sponge count were correct. The patient was
in stable condition at the conclusion of the procedure and was taken back to the recovery unit in stable
condition.

Case 4
A 59-year-old female with right mixed-hearing loss from chronic ear disease with history of surgical
treatment seeks intervention for improved quality of life at work and socially. A magnetic
transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing device is placed in the right retrosigmoid location because the
right mastoid is contracted and inflamed.
Procedure Description:
Make an incision followed by meticulous dissection through the pericranium. Perform a subpericranial
dissection and create a subpericranial pocket for the implant coil and magnet. Identify the area for the
transducer using the template and mark on the outer table of the skull in the region of the sinodural
angle. Then drill surgical guide and fixation holes taking care not to penetrate the sigmoid sinus or the
dura overlying the temporal lobe of the brain. Measure this area for appropriate depth to accommodate
the fixation screw.
Then drill the skull overlying the sinodural angle, greater than or equal to 100 sq mm, to create a well in
the bone to accommodate the transducer device, again staying just superficial to the dura and sigmoid
sinus. Place the entire device, including the coil, magnet, and transducer portions. Fix the device to the
skull using the fixation screw to a specific torque setting. Carefully measure the thickness of the flap
overlying the magnet and coil portion of the device and precisely trim to a specific thickness to allow for
transcutaneous transmission. Irrigate the wound and obtain hemostasis. Close the wound in layered
fashion.
